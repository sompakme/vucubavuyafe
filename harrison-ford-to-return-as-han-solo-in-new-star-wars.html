Legitimate sources...his deal is done. It's just a formality, right now. They haven't really announced it yet."</p><p>Ford's deal to return to the franchise was "significant," Gonzalez claimed, but he was unable to confirm whether the actor's role in the series will be a major one or a cameo.</p><p>"The deal is pretty big...it's significant," he said.</p><p><strong>Check out video of Gonzales' interview below (<i>Star Wars</i> bit kicks in at around 6min 20sec):</strong></p><p>There's been no official comment from Ford's publicist or Disney on the reported casting.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p>But according to EW.com writer <strong>Geoff Boucher</strong>, Ford has yet to ink a deal.</p><p>"Harrison Ford deal?

No one seems sure about it," he wrote.</p><p>"I was told some time ago that Ford, <strong>Carrie Fisher</strong>, and <strong>Mark Hamill</strong> would be reprising their roles in Episode &, Obviously this new movie won't pick up where <i>Return of the Jedi</i> ended. It's some time in the future.</p><p>He continued, "Han, Princess Leia (with a presumably better hairstyle), and Luke Skywalker will be a lot older. Their children will be the new main characters."</p><p>Adding, "But suffice to say, the three main actors are definitely coming back."</p><p>Disney announced in October that it will revive the classic sci-fi franchise by releasing a new trilogy.</p><p><i>Star Wars: Episode VII</i>, directed by <strong>J.J.

The Fett film would be set in-between two of the three original films.</p><p>Last week, <strong>Ewan McGregor</strong>, who starred as a younger Obi-Wan Kenobi in the prequel trilogy, said he would be willing to pick up his lightsaber once again.</p><p>McGregor told <a href=#>MTV News</a> he liked the idea of a standalone film starring the Jedi knight.</p><p>"I think it's a good idea," McGregor said, adding: "The only bit that I could get away with doing is after the last one I made, Episode III, before <strong>Alec Guinness</strong>, there's that period where he's in the desert.</p><p>"That might be my window, there, to tell that story.

"He's collecting the two franchises and holding them close to his vest. He's probably the most talented director of that ilk that we have, but he's gone too far this time."</p><p>Shatner added, "I think of him as a buddy of mine. I've taken him out for sushi.
