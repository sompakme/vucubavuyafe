In the caption, he partially wrote, “We lost a legend yesterday. My life was forever changed for the better the day I met <a href=# id=auto-tag_carl-weathers_1 data-tag=carl-weathers>Carl Weathers</a>.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the minute-long video, the Tulsa King star explained that the film franchise wouldn’t have been what it became had it not been for Weathers’ Apollo Creed.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Today is an incredibly sad day for me,” Stallone began the video. “I mean, I’m so torn up I can’t even tell you. I’m just trying to hold it in because Carl Weathers was such an integral part of my life, my success, everything about it. I give him incredible credit and kudos, because when he walked into that room, and I saw him for the first time, I saw greatness, but I didn’t realize how great.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He continued, “I never could have accomplished what we did with Rocky without him. He was absolutely brilliant. His voice, his size, his power, his athletic ability, but more importantly, his heart, his soul. It’s a horrible loss.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Rambo star explained that he was standing in front of an abstract painting of him and Weathers because it was probably the last moment they were ever in the ring together, and that’s something he will never forget.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He was magic, and I was so fortunate to be part of his life,” he concluded. “So, Apollo, keep punching.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Amazon MGM Studios also shared in a statement, “Everyone at Amazon MGM Studios is devastated by the loss of the extraordinary Carl Weathers. Almost 50 years ago, he brought to life one of the most iconic characters to grace the screen, Apollo Creed — a character who will live on in our cinematic lives. Carl went on to build an inspiring career defined by a true Apollo Creed-like passion. That drive — accompanied by his unbelievable kindness and big heart — is a legacy that will live on in our industry and beyond for years to come. Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Carl’s family and loved ones during this difficult time.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Happy Gilmore director Dennis Dugan and star Adam Sandler also <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/carl-weathers-dead-happy-gilmore-director-adam-sandler-tributes-1235813882/ rel="noreferrer noopener">paid tribute to Weathers</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLTFy6%2BcrKyVp3q0wMClo6imlWK%2Fpq3Crapmm5GnuW7DxJqroZ2iqHqlscCdZGpqY2qFcoCPcG1o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-queues-the-tiktok-hysteria-no7-s-new-damage-reversal-skincare-is-having-a-moment.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The queues!
