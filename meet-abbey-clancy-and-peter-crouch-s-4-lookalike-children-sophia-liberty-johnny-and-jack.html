Sophia takes after her mum with long golden-brown locks and a clear passion for fashion after being on the receiving end of high-end clothes and shoes for birthdays. As with any teenage girl, famous or not, her father has been the source of embarrassment with Peter telling <a class=hm-link href=#>Jonathan Ross&nbsp;</a>that her friends used to tease her for having such a tall dad.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More celebrity children</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/17f9ece612c7-prince-harry-meghan-markle-children.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet Jack Nicholson's six children from five different women" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c8d66bdd1a38-gettyimages-145937425.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet Jack Nicholson's six children from five different women" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet Jack Nicholson's six children from five different women</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meet Zara and Mike Tindall's three adorable children: Mia, Lena and Lucas" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f19b13d1240b-zara-tindall-mike-tindall-children.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meet Zara and Mike Tindall's three adorable children: Mia, Lena and Lucas" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meet Zara and Mike Tindall's three adorable children: Mia, Lena and Lucas</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=elVYkuRT7w_j data-wc=79>He joked: "My little girl, the eldest one, I took her to summer camp and she was like, 'Dad don't come in'' because the kids were making fun because her dad was so tall.

It's amazing how she's changed!"</p><p id=e_MAGwSDYBmn data-wc=52>Not only following in her mother's footsteps, Sophia is also a keen sportsperson like her dad and participates in swimming competitions, often bringing home prizes.

"God help my @petercrouch," Abbey joked on Twitter after the birth. Now, almost nine years later, Liberty is the spitting image of her older sister, sharing her golden hair and cheeky smile.</p><p id=ekOAaDxfzNqb data-wc=49>She has also followed in her mother’s footsteps having appeared in modelling campaigns such as Frozen Fashion Week in 2020 which saw both sisters dressing up as Frozen characters Anna and Elsa. The two girls walked the runway and were photographed by Mary McCartney, the daughter of Sir Paul.</p><p id=eeylasc_L5Ev data-wc=39>Abbey <a class=hm-link href=#>previously told HELLO!</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>"I wouldn't force them into doing it, [modelling].

He has been the source of mum-shaming for Abbey when she shared an image on social media of the four-year-old sucking on a dummy. Instagram users commented. "Isn’t he a bit old for a dummy?," fans asked at the time. Unphased, Abbey didn’t bother responding to the comments.</p><p id=elppGFrKj3J8 data-wc=67>Jack has also divided the internet when he was pictured in a Liverpool football kit on his first birthday. Followers on Instagram commented on the all-red outfit stating it was "honestly shocking from Crouch allowing him to wear a Liverpool kit".
