Hela promises that she give him something he desires even more than a hammer or the Infinity Gems, and that's death.

He is a big eater and enjoys the honey-based drink mead. As the champion of order in the world, he battles against giants and other monsters. It might be because of his power and strength that he appears in so many stories.<h2>Is Hela Frigga's daughter?</h2>The identity of Hela's mother wasn't revealed in the film, but as it turns out, she's actually Thor's half-sister, as she isn't the daughter of Frigga.
