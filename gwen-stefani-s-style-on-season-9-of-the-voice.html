And we have Hollywood power stylists <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Rob Zangardi and Mariel Haenn</a> to thank—they're the masterminds behind every one of Stefani's looks (they also have stars like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Jennifer Lopez</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Rachel McAdams</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Cara Delevingne</a> on their roster of A-list clients). Now that season 9 of The Voice has wrapped, we caught up with the duo (whose schedules are insane btw—they're currently tasked with outfitting Lopez for her Las Vegas show) to chat about all things Stefani, but first we had to know: What's she like?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's kind of a dream client," Zangardi laughs. "The genius thing about working with Gwen is that she can pull off anything. She has a strong personal style to begin with, which allows us to push the envelope."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before the season started, they knocked out one giant fitting, during which they locked down about 20 looks, but what neither one of them anticipated was Stefani's shift in mood, which led to surprising last-minute outfit decisions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the past, we've done avant-garde, tomboy-ish edgy looks, but this season, it was a nice surprise when she said, 'I feel like I want to be more feminine,'" Haenn says. "We were used to her loving blazers and drop-crotch pants, but then we had to readjust our way of thinking. We were looking at things that we would normally never look at. We wouldn't be sure about something, but we'd pull it and she'd see it and love it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The result was a line-up brimming with looks that felt like a marked departure from her usual punk attire, like flirty fringe dresses, ethereal gowns, and printed A-line numbers. "It came out very '60s mod, which wasn't intentionally done, but it happened that way," Haenn continues. "We kept going with it because it was working."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"There were a lot more form-fitted dresses, sexier things she wouldn't normally wear, more cleavage-baring pieces," Zangardi chimes in. "She even told us last night, 'I love that I did something totally new this season, something I've never done before.'"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But of course that's not to say Stefani lost sight of her personal style. Her affinity for prints was still there, as was her signature punk 'tude, which was evident in her love for fishnets (her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>faves are from Capezio</a>). In the words of Zangardi: "It all still felt Gwen-y."
