He is, after all, the steely eyed actor whose famous on-screen villains have hearts even harder than their die-cast abs. Ben Barnes is also a warm-throated singer whose<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> recent Spotify singles</a> are jazzy bops about true love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I don’t see them as conflicting things,” he says. “Love and fear and power: they’re all just different aspects of the human condition. It’s literally my job to explore them. But yeah, when I get home from work, sometimes I’m just really tired.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>L: Versace jacket and pants.

Barnes’s accidental specialty is playing really broken people and doing it so well that audiences hold their breath while he broods. There was Billy Russo (aka Jigsaw), the slash-jawed Marvel baddie from The Punisher; and Logan Delos, the calculating Westworld heir with seemingly less humanity than the show’s actual androids. Barnes’s current project, Shadow and Bone, has him playing General Kirigan, a gloomster in black leather whose goal is to plunge the world into darkness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s really fun to play this really powerful guy who’s got the highest status in the room. He’s dealing with all these inner demons — I mean, he’s an actual monster — but he also knows how to use charm as a weapon and manipulate people so skillfully. He’s so slick! But you should know,” he laughs. “That is 100% not me!”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-1 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Versace jacket and pants.

He attended Kingston University (fun fact: So did Eric Clapton) and scored an academic prize for English Literature, based partly on a Harry Potter essay about “modes of masculinity and the nature of a quest” in fantasy stories — a topic eerily relevant to the “toxic masculinity” that chokes his Shadow and Bone villain.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Barnes then worked on a jazz album with American Idol creator and writer Simon Fuller and joined a boy band called<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1> Hyrise</a> (“Briefly!” he emphasizes) before screen-testing for the role of Edward Cullen in<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> Twilight</a> and winning the role of Prince Caspian in The Chronicles of Narnia movies. And thus, a British heartthrob was born — albeit one who analyzes his characters with the precision of both a lit major and a psychoanalytic nepo baby.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Citizens of Humanity jean jacket and T-shirt.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jonny Marlow</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’ve always wanted to be like [my parents] in lots of ways,” Barnes explains. “My mom is particularly interested in people and their quirks, their problems, their fights, and their vulnerabilities ... She’s one of those people [who] you share everything with, and I think that I’m one of those people in some ways, too.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He describes a piece of his artistic process as “weaponized empathy — the ability to have compassion for most anybody by stepping into their shoes,” even the slew of characters he’s played that are capable of great evil.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-2 mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Citizens of Humanity jean jacket, T-Shirt, and jeans.

I tried Love Is Blind, but I dropped it after the first season. Right now, it’s these British reality shows called The Traitor, which is so good, and one called Race Across the World ... and I found these very, very tiny cookies that I really like. I know there’s a bag of them somewhere in the house, but I haven’t been eating very healthily these past few months, so I’m trying to be really, really healthy starting this week. So I’m going to … I don’t know … reward myself by not eating those cookies, even though they’re really good?” he laughs. “I’m gonna go and work on trying to write some new music with a friend of mine instead. How about that? That’s a real reward.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image--theme-3 instyle-sc-block-image--large instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image theme-3 mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Brunello Cucinelli jacket and pants.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Johnny Marlow</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for what’s next for Barnes? A romantic comedy isn’t totally out of the question. “When Harry Met Sally is my favorite movie of all time,” he says. “But it’s so perfect that they shouldn’t ever remake it. If they make Notting Hill though, I’m so in. I’ll take Hugh Grant’s role ... and then Julia Roberts can stay in the Julia Roberts role. Please.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to find out why Barnes's favorite Hollywood Chris isn't a Chris at all and how his mixtape picks are firmly rooted in the '00s.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>What’s your favorite bagel?</strong><br>What’s the flat one, poppy seeds or sesame seeds?
