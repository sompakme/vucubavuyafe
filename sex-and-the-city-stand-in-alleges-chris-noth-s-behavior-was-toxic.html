Some of the behavior I saw still shocks me</a>,” Kristin — who says she stood in for Davis’ Charlotte for four seasons on the original <a href=# id=auto-tag_hbo data-tag=hbo>HBO</a> series — wrote about an “alpha male actor” who made an offensive comment about a fellow stand-in.</p><p>In an update to that column <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">published Thursday</a>, Kristin names that actor as Noth, writing, “I remember his toxic behavior all too vividly.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Kristin writes, “The first time the ‘alpha male’ actor slid his hand down my back and over my butt, I flinched. I was in my mid-20s and had worked as an extra on movie sets for over a decade; I had never been manhandled. ‘That’s your spot, sweetie,’ Noth said, inching even closer.”</p><p>Kristin says she did her best to stay out of his path following the interaction: “My gut said to quit that first day. Instead, I stayed too long, like staying in a bad relationship for far too many years, hoping I’d persevere and land my big break.”</p><p>About a year later, Kristin alleges that Noth pointed to the stand-in for Cynthia Nixon’s Miranda and said, “I want that one tied up, gagged and brought to my trailer.” She writes, “When he got near me, I balled up my fists, squared my shoulders and said, ‘This is my and her space.’ He backed up, dramatically putting his hands up in the air and said, ‘Whoa, there, little lady!’ He didn’t even know my name. I clenched my jaw and didn’t respond. The crew laughed. But I had had enough; I finally stood up for myself and for the other stand-in.”</p><p>On Dec. 16, two women <a href=# rel=noopener>alleged they were sexually assaulted by Noth.</a> Zoe, now 40, and Lily, now 31 — who do not know each other and who used pseudonyms for the story — approached THR separately and months apart with their stories, each deciding to come forward after being triggered by Noth starring in the revival of the iconic series with <a href=# id=auto-tag_hbo-max data-tag=hbo-max>HBO Max</a>‘s <a href=# id=auto-tag_and-just-like-that data-tag=and-just-like-that>And Just Like That</a> reboot, which killed off Noth’s Mr. Big character in its first episode.</p><p>Noth, who denies the allegations, was swiftly dropped by his agency and his other show, CBS’ The Equalizer, following the story. Peloton also pulled a viral ad it had created with Noth and Ryan Reynolds following Mr. Big’s death.</p><p>Stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Nixon and Davis have since supported the women who came forward <a href=# rel=noopener>in a joint statement</a>.</p><p>“When Mr. Big, the character played by Chris Noth, died in the first episode of the SATC reboot And Just Like That, I felt relief,” wrote Kristin in her updated essay Thursday. “I’m sure the three women [a third woman came forward to the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Daily Beast</a>] who have come forward in the last week with allegations of sexual assault against Noth felt the same.”</p><p>Kristin also claims that, following the publication of her original essay, she was met with silence by the And Just Like That casting director when she reached out about returning as a stand-in for the reboot. “I found myself wondering whether I was being blacklisted for speaking out,” she says, questioning Noth’s demise onscreen. “Was Big killed off in the first episode because the producers knew of his troubles?”</p><p>A rep for Noth denies the allegations, telling THR, “Now that everyone is piling onto Chris Noth, the timing is unquestionably convenient to drag him into her ‘recollection’ of events. Chris denies these allegations and there’s never been a single complaint or report about him acting inappropriately on the set of Sex and the City.”</p><p>THR has reached out to HBO and HBO Max, as well as Kristin, for additional comment.</p><p>Big’s death was reportedly <a href=# rel=noopener>a big plot point in the third SATC film</a>, which never made it to the screen. In a 2018 Sex and the City chapter for James Andrew Miller’s Origins podcast, the host reported that Big was set to die “relatively early” in the film of a heart attack in the shower, per the screenplay. At the time, Miller said the narrative of Big’s death and its focus on Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) made Kim Cattrall — who was responsible for the third film never getting off the ground — uninterested in reprising her role of Samantha Jones.</p><p>And Just Like That showrunner Michael Patrick King recently told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Vanity Fair</a> that Big’s death was the “origin story” of the reboot. “Nobody wanted to come back if [the show] was not going to be different,” he said. “The more [Noth and Patrick King] talked about it, the more he understood that it was for Carrie — and Carrie’s storyline is, it’s better to have loved and lost than never have loved at all.”</p><p><strong>Dec. 23, 11 a.m.:</strong> Updated to include Noth’s rep’s response.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrJyxZZGjsW7Ax55knKGkrnq0wMCnm2ahnmKytL%2FAsmScoKKewG66zq2fZmliaIJxgpVxcG1n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./all-the-details-on-cece-s-wedding-dress.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>All the Details on CeCe's Wedding Dress</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./young-jeezy-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Young Jeezy Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
