Trash games are virtual reality games that are full of glitches, bugs, and errors, making them very difficult and frustrating to play. Rakurou, however, enjoys the challenge and has become an expert in clearing these games. He even has a nickname, “Sunraku”, which means “trash game lover”.</p><p>One day, after finishing one of the worst trash games he has ever played, Rakurou decides to try a good game for a change. He buys a copy of Shangri-La Frontier, the most popular and acclaimed VR game in the world. Shangri-La Frontier is a massive online role-playing game that boasts over 10 billion registered players, stunning graphics, and endless possibilities. Rakurou creates his character, also named Sunraku, and enters the game world.</p><p>He soon realizes that Shangri-La Frontier is not as perfect as it seems. The game is constantly updated with new content, but also with new bugs and glitches. Some of these bugs are harmless, but some are dangerous and can even kill the players. Rakurou, however, is not deterred by these challenges. He uses his skills and experience from playing trash games to overcome obstacles and explore the vast and mysterious world of Shangri-La Frontier. Along the way, he meets and befriends other players, such as Psyger 0, a female hacker who can manipulate the game system, Arthur Pencilgon, a male artist who can create anything with his pencil, Oikatzo, a male warrior who is obsessed with collecting rare items, and Emul, a female elf who is the key to the game’s secrets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Release_Date></span><strong>Release Date </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shangri-La Frontier Season 1 is a new anime series that premiered on <strong>October 1, 2023,</strong> on MBS and TBS channels in Japan.
