Read on for her top diet and exercise tips, as well as her reasons for getting herself into such amazing shape…<strong>Before my health kick I was eating doughnuts for breakfast…</strong>Then pizza for lunch and I was putting on pounds every week. I knew I wasn't big, but I also knew that if I carried on that way, I’d put on more weight and get more cellulite.<strong>Some horrible pap pictures kicked me into action…</strong>I saw nasty pictures during my holiday and when I got back home I tried to do up my jeans but couldn't… That's when I knew something had to change and I had to start training. Now, I exercise around four time a week. If I can't fit it in, I'll try and walk somewhere rather than drive.<strong>Now I can't imagine not exercising…</strong>Not in a million years. I would be really unhappy. I've had breaks of about a week where I've actually done nothing and I think you feel a bit negative… I just don't feel good about myself. I'll never get back to that state again, I'm happy at a size eight now.<strong>I eat quite clean…</strong>After training in the morning, within half an hour I have a green juice. Within one hour of training, I have my breakfast which is usually scrambled egg and turkey or spinach. Lunch is normally a salmon and avocado salad and for dinner I'll have a chicken stir fry. I don’t buy the sauce though – I make the sauce myself with soy and season it. Those lovely sweet chilli sauces are full of calories!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19ac41e4d964-lucy-2-z.jpg><p id=e3hnuXL5HriY data-wc=368><strong>I try not to snack too much…</strong>But if I do, I keep them healthy. I'll always have olives in the fridge, as well as hummous and vegetables.<strong>I do treat myself…</strong>For a naughty snack, I'll have strawberries dipped in dark chocolate. Last weekend I had the girls round for a barbeque and I did have a few little M&S desserts that weren't exactly healthy!<strong>I advise three months to get completely bikini body-ready…</strong>Three months is the amount of time I believe is healthy to get good results and see a real difference with cellulite. Don't just rely on exercise, though, you have to eat clean – you can't out-exercise a bad diet! The training is pointless if you don't eat well.<strong>If you've only got three months…</strong>You have to eat clean and train one to two times per day. If you're going to do it in a short amount of time, you have to prepare to work harder. You have to be very strict.<strong>My Bootycamp is really fun…</strong>I used to go on bootcamps a lot for an exercise kickstart, but I would come home dreading getting into exercise because it was so hard and militant. But then I started training with my personal trainer and I realised that exercise isn't that horrible! I wanted to change how bootcamps were, so that was my main aim of Bootycamp – to make exercise fun and light-hearted. Girls will experience a wide variety of exercises and I wanted them to leave with a smile on their faces.<strong>It's still tough…</strong>There are difficult circuits in the programme but in between there are burlesque classes and hula hoop classes which are still really hard and definitely help you lose weight and tone up.<strong>You can lose up to seven pounds over the weekend…</strong>We never wanted to go down the 'massive weight loss' route but actually, we didn't realise just how effective it was going to be. We've had girls losing about seven pounds in a weekend.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
