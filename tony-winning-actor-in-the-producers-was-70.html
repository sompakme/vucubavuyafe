He was 70.</p><p>Unger said Beach died Tuesday at his home in Palm Springs. No cause was given.</p><p>Beach’s other Broadway roles included Lumiere in Beauty and the Beast and Albin in the 2004 revival of La Cage aux Folles, both of which earned him Tony nominations.</p><p>The Producers opened in 2001 and starred Nathan Lane as Max and Matthew Broderick as Leo, and featured Cady Huffman as Ulla and Roger Bart as Carmen Ghia.</p><p>Beach played the self-absorbed and beyond-flamboyant director who gets to go on as Hitler and leads the cast in Springtime for Hitler, the show’s most famous number. He reprised the role in the 2005 film.</p><p>Born in Alexandria, Virginia, Beach at age 11 saw the original road tour of The Music Man, starring Forrest Tucker, at Washington’s National Theatre and was hooked on musical theater.</p><p>“I always wanted to be a performer, but it never occurred to me to be a television performer or a movie actor,” Beach told the Associated Press in 2001. “To me, it was always Broadway.”</p><p>Beach started college at Old Dominion in Norfolk, Virginia, as a political science major but read a magazine article about the North Carolina School of the Arts, where “show business goes to school” — and found his true calling.</p><p>He did over 1,000 performances in New York and on the road of three musicals — Annie, Les Miserables and Beauty and Beast — and over 800 performances in 1776, the show that got him to Broadway.</p><p>Beach survived flops — The Mooney Shapiro Songbook, a one-performance bomb in 1981 — and moments of intense gladness, like the comedy Legends by Chorus Line author James Kirkwood and starring two real-life theater legends, Mary Martin and Carol Channing.</p><p>“The first day of rehearsal in Los Angeles, there I was, sitting between Peter Pan and Dolly Levi and trying to pretend there was absolutely nothing wrong with this picture,” he recalled with a laugh.</p><p>After nearly 20 years in New York, Beach moved to Los Angeles. “I fell in love with the idea of having a car like an adult,” he said. There, he acted in such shows as The John Larroquette Show; Murder, She Wrote; Saved by the Bell; and Will & Grace.</p><p>Beach stayed in California for 13 years, only coming back to do Beauty and the Beast. He broke his ankle during the run after falling off a stack of dishes, went back to Los Angeles and got a call asking him to do a reading of The Producers.</p><p>Beach’s favorite moment in the show was a section of lyrics added to the Springtime for Hitler number during the pre-Broadway run in Chicago.</p><p>“It’s when Hitler does the tap challenge with the Allies and ends up rolling the wheelchair-bound Franklin Roosevelt off the stage,” Beach explained. “Brooks wrote, ‘It ain’t no mystery/ If it’s politics or history/ The thing you’ve got to know is/ Everything is show biz.'”</p><p>Beach then told Brooks, “You know what you’ve done? You’ve made The Producers the toughest satire on Broadway.”</p><p>In a statement, The Baruch Frankel Routh Viertel Group, the producers of The Producers, honored Beach as “an actor of consummate skill and artistry, was a glorious human being; a gifted, generous and incredibly funny actor whose presence in a rehearsal room or on the stage lifted everyone’s spirit and inspired them to be the best they could be.”</p><p>He is survived by his husband, Jeffrey Barnett.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKit0bJkm52RmLVusMieqmasn6PGbsPIp6WippdirqTAzqtkqaqfmcKksdGsZLCZo2KEcXmQamlxamBufA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-did-lewis-hamilton-and-nicole-scherzinger-split-up-inside-their-on-off-romance.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why did Lewis Hamilton and Nicole Scherzinger split up?
