He was 53.</p><p>Rose died Friday at his home in Burbank, his best friend and business partner, Chad Waters, told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter. The family was awaiting a coroner’s report as to the cause of death, but “all signs point to natural causes.”</p><p>A protege of makeup legends Stan Winston and <a href=# id=auto-tag_rick-baker data-tag=rick-baker>Rick Baker</a> — he spent 15 years at the latter’s Cinovation Studios in Glendale — Rose also contributed to other notable effects-driven films like&nbsp;Aliens&nbsp;(1986),&nbsp;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&nbsp;(1990) and&nbsp;The Nutty Professor&nbsp;(1996).</p><p>According to a <a href=# rel=nofollow>story</a> on the website Daily Dead, Rose and Waters figured that actor Ron Perlman would be just perfect for&nbsp;Hellboy, so they used his likeness for the sculptures that they presented to director <a href=# id=auto-tag_guillermo-del-toro data-tag=guillermo-del-toro>Guillermo del Toro</a> to get the 2004 movie — based on the Dark Horse Comics’ half-demon character — rolling.</p><p>“Once&nbsp;Hellboy&nbsp;was greenlit, Matt and Chad spent six months in Prague, working on Ron nearly every single day, and when it comes to the characters and creatures he had created throughout his entire career, Hellboy was one of his very favorites,” Heather Wixson, who recently interviewed Rose, wrote on the site.</p><p>On Twitter, Del Toro <a href=# rel=nofollow>lamented</a> Rose’s death: “Matt Rose passing hurts deep. If our craft ever had a golden age, he was one of the Titans. And a real pal: approachable, generous and full of love.”</p><p>And on Instagram, Baker <a href=# rel=nofollow>wrote</a> that Rose “never failed to make me look good.”</p><p>“I have been lucky enough to have [had] some of the most amazingly talented artists work with me on many projects, but none more talented than Matt,” he continued. “Matt could sculpt a maquette in no time, and they didn’t look like a quick sculpt but a piece of art.”</p><p>Rose did prosthetics for Martin Landau on <a href=# id=auto-tag_tim-burton data-tag=tim-burton>Tim Burton</a>‘s&nbsp;Ed Wood&nbsp;(1994), and the actor went on to win an Oscar for his portrayal of&nbsp;Dracula&nbsp;star Bela Lugosi. (Baker, Ve Neill and Yolanda Toussieng shared the Academy Award for best makeup.)</p><p>Rose had first collaborated with Burton on&nbsp;Beetlejuice&nbsp;(1988).</p><p>Rose also worked with Baker as a sculptor on the Joel Schumacher films&nbsp;Batman Forever&nbsp;(1995) and&nbsp;Batman & Robin&nbsp;(1997), on the first two&nbsp;Men in Black&nbsp;films from Barry Sonnenfeld and on Burton’s&nbsp;Planet of the Apes.</p><p>His more recent credits included&nbsp;Star Trek Beyond&nbsp;(2016) and the 2017 Netflix movie&nbsp;Bright.</p><p>Born Oct. 22, 1965, Rose was raised in San Jose, Calif., and sculpted monsters out of clay as a kid. One of his first professional jobs came at the L.A. Effects Group, where he designed miniatures for Winston on James Cameron’s&nbsp;Aliens.</p><p>That gig led to more work with Winston on such films as&nbsp;Invaders From Mars&nbsp;(1986),&nbsp;Predator&nbsp;(1987) and&nbsp;The Monster Squad&nbsp;(1987).&nbsp;</p><p>Rose went on to work alongside Baker on about two dozen films; those included&nbsp;Harry and the Hendersons&nbsp;(1987),&nbsp;Gorillas in the Mist&nbsp;(1988),&nbsp;The Rocketeer&nbsp;(1991),&nbsp;Wolf&nbsp;(1994),&nbsp;Mighty Joe Young&nbsp;(1998),&nbsp;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&nbsp;(2000) and&nbsp;The Ring&nbsp;(2002).</p><p>“I love this industry. I love the craft,” Rose said in his interview with Wixson. “I love everything about it, but the best thing out of my career is knowing all of my colleagues. I really mean that. Even if you have arguments, there is still this sense of camaraderie that we all share. We have all been in the same battles together, and we understand the importance of being supportive for each other, even if we don’t always agree 100 percent on everything.”&nbsp;</p><p>Survivors include his parents Anna and Mike; siblings Michael, Pamella, Cathy, Mark and Stephanie; and six nieces and nephews.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK6t061kq6ejmnqlscCdZKaZm5rCsXnAq6uiq6Ritaa4y5umsmWVmXq4u86dZLCZo2KCdHmQam9pbmdlfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pippa-middleton-s-twinning-fashion-moments-with-stylish-sister-princess-kate.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pippa Middleton's twinning fashion moments with stylish sister Princess Kate</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-have-not-had-a-girlfriend-for-a-long-time-falz-says-as-he-talks-about-his-love-life-video.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>I have not had a girlfriend for a long time - Falz says as he talks about his love life (video)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
