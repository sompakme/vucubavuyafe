It is not for you to investigate how the money is utilised.”</i></p><p class=align-left>The man of God however said that it is compulsory for pastors to give account of the tithe and other offerings paid by church members to avoid corruption.</p><p class=align-left>In his own opinion, pastor Adenuga said tithing has become controversial because some men of God have betrayed the gospel and their calling.</p><p class=align-left>He said: <i>“They spend tithes to set up businesses and establish schools for the purpose of making money. Instead of using tithes to pay good salaries to their full-time pastors, they recruit part-time rich pastors who won’t bother them about salaries since they are already comfortable.”</i></p><p class=align-left>He concluded that tithe is meant for the welfare of pastors and the needy, not for acquiring properties, exotic vehicles and private jets and advised members to hold their pastors accountable on the issue of tithes.</p><p class=align-left>Bishop Gbonigi stated that paying tithes to the church is biblical, though it doesn’t have to be cash.</p><p class=align-left>He also quoted some biblical verses such as Genesis 14:20, 28:22, Leviticus 27: 30-34, Deuteronomy 14: 22-29, 2Chronicle 31: 5-10, etc. to support his view.</p><p class=align-left>For Archbishop Makinde, refusing to pay tithe is robbing God and those that refuse to pay tithes are punishing themselves.</p><p class=align-left>He said: <i>“I have spent 45 unbroken years in the ministry and I rose to the pinnacle of my career as the Prelate and head of Methodist Church Nigeria. If people say they will not pay it, they are punishing themselves. I learnt how to tithe through my wife and I have never regretted it and I won’t regret it now. You cannot rob God.”</i></p><p class=align-left>Reverend Osu’s opinion differs as he stated that tithing is not compulsory in Catholic Church.</p><p class=align-left>He said: <i>Payment of tithe, like other donations made in the Catholic Church, is not obligatory. This means that members are not compelled to pay the tithe. It is purely voluntary. Also, Catholics are under no obligation to pay a certain percentage of their income to the church as a tithe. In the early history of our church, the priests depended upon the generous support of congregations for their sustenance. This custom was based on the New Testament instruction: Jesus taught the apostles to depend upon charity when He sent them on a mission (see Matthew 10:10). St. Paul also instructed the early Church community to provide for the needs of their priests (I Corinthians 9:13).</i></p><p class=align-left>According to Archbishop Kaigama, paying tithe is clearly stated in the scripture.</p><p class=align-left>He said that tithes are meant to be given to those who are poor and in need or to promote activities that are favourable to the poor.</p><p class=align-left>He added that: <i>“The tithe, including church collections in the bazaars they do, are meant to promote the work of God, promote evangelism, and take care of needy people in the society. But it doesn’t exclude taking care of the priests or the pastors whose duty it is to preach the word of God because they have no salaries, and no income elsewhere.”</i></p><p class=align-left>He concluded that while tithing is scriptural, pastors must not use tithes collected from their members to run their personal businesses or take care of their families by sending their children to the best schools.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Legit.ng</strong> previously reported that Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor and Bishop David Oyedepo spoke on why Christians should pay tithe.</p><p class=align-left>Bishop Oyedepo, the founder and presiding bishop of Living Faith Church Worldwide, while speaking at the church’s recently organised Shiloh programme explained why Christians should pay tithe.</p><p class=align-left>He said God will not open heavens for someone who doesn’t pay tithe no matter what the person does.</p><p class=align-left>Pastor Oritsejafor, the founding and senior pastor of Word of Life Bible Church also echoed Bishop Oyedepo’s teaching. He said people shouldn’t listen to those who say they shouldn’t pay their tithes. He made this known while speaking at the Redeemed Christian Church of God convention.</p><p class=align-left>Is it really appropriate for Christians to pay tithe?
