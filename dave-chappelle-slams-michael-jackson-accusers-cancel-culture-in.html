Kelly and Kevin Hart, all within the first 20 minutes of his new Netflix special, Sticks & Stones, which was released Monday.</p><p>In his fifth special in the past two years, the comedian tackles “cancel culture,” or as he describes it, “celebrity hunting season.”</p><p>“This is the worst time ever to be a celebrity,” Chappelle says in the special. “You’re gonna be finished. Everyone’s doomed. Michael Jackson has been dead for 10 years, and this n— has two new cases.”</p><p>He then reiterated for those who have yet to watch HBO’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Leaving Neverland,</a> which detailed Jackson’s alleged child abuse throughout his career, “Don’t watch it. … It’s fucking gross.”</p><p>Chappelle went on to explain that though it may not be the right thing to say, he admits that he doesn’t believe the accusers who allege that the King of Pop sexually abused and raped them. “I don’t think he did it, but you know what? Even if he did do it … you know what I mean?” he paused, as the audience erupted into laughter. “I mean, it’s Michael Jackson. I know more than half the people in this room have been molested in their lives, but it wasn’t no goddamn Michael Jackson, was it?”</p><p>Chappelle asserts that had the accusers really been sexually abused by Jackson, “You know how good it must have felt to go to school the next day after that shit?”</p><p>The main reason Chappelle said he doesn’t believe the accusers is because Macaulay Culkin has yet to come forward saying he was ever molested by Jackson or witnessed the singer assaulting anyone: “I’m not a pedophile, but if I was, Macaulay Culkin’s the first kid I’m fucking — I’ll tell you that right now.”</p><p>Chappelle also discussed the sexual abuse allegations against R. Kelly, whom he described as being “different” from Jackson because Chappelle is “pretty sure he did that.” The comedian also explained that though he was offered the chance to be on Lifetime’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Surviving R. Kelly</a>, he didn’t appear because he did not know the singer “at all.”</p><p>“This guy makes more sex tape than he does music. He’s like the DJ Khaled of sex tapes,” the comedian said, before shouting DJ Khaled’s signature phrase, “Another one!”</p><p>Chappelle denied Surviving R. Kelly executive producer <a href=# rel=noopener>Dream Hampton</a>‘s statement that Chappelle said he wouldn’t be involved because the series was “too hot for TV.” “I did not say that. That does not even sound like I talk,” said the comic.</p><p>Chappelle also took a moment to defend “poor Kevin Hart,” explaining that he was aware it was the comedian’s “dream to <a href=# rel=noopener>host the Oscars</a>.” “I don’t know what you know about Kevin, but I know that Kevin Hart is damn-near perfect,” said Chappelle. “As close to perfect as anybody I’ve ever seen. In fact, Kevin is precisely four tweets shy of being perfect.”</p><p>Sticks & Stones is available to stream now on Netflix.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnZivnV2YtaK8z56jpZ1dqLmiudJmpKKbmJayrXnJmpqkq5%2BjeqKvwq6qnqqjYrCiusKeo2abpaHBtr7EZqWerJahtrl50qmcnKGRoXpyfpJtbWxrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./finish-line-coupons-10-off-in-july-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Finish Line coupons - $10 OFF in July 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chrisean-rock-gets-backlash-for-allegedly-smoking-during-pregnancy-on-tv.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chrisean Rock Gets Backlash For Allegedly Smoking During Pregnancy On TV</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
