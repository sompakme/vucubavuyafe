Overall, he has done pretty much everything. He has been an actor, a TV host, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and even an artist</a>. Although he has accomplished so much, it is clear that he is not yet satisfied with everything he has done. There is still a lot left for him to do, and fans are always excited to hear about his next project. In fact, his latest project is one that has been teased for quite a while, and it is in conjunction with the notorious Zeus Network.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the video below, you can find the trailer for Bad Vs. Wild. This is a new show that will be dropping on March 3rd. Overall, the show has an interesting variety concept. There are going to be live performances from some of the biggest artists in hip-hop, such as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>GloRilla</a> and even <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>French Montana</a>. However, there are also going to be a lot of fights. Reality stars Joseline Hernandez and Natalie Nunn will be on the show. In fact, the two can be seen fighting in the trailer, which is definitely going to bring some viewers in.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nick-cannon-has-a-new-show>Nick Cannon Has A New Show</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Karlissa Saffold is also going to be on the show, and it looks like she is throwing punches. Beyond that, it remains to be seen what this show is going to have in store. It is clear that Zeus Network and Nick Cannon are pulling out all of the stops for this new show. Whether or not it ends up being a success, still remains to be seen. However, given the success of properties like Baddies and Crazy In Love, it seems like Bad Vs. Wild has a lot of potential.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of this new show idea, in the comments section down below.
