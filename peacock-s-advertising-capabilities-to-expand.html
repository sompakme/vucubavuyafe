The plan, which is an expansion of <a href=#>last year’s announcement</a> of a self-serve ad platform for small and medium size businesses, will see NBCU committing to 30 live events per month.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“For the first time ever, you know, a small business could be buying into the World Cup,” says James Kreckler, senior VP of digital advertising for the company. “Most people that are in that space, they never really thought they could buy NBCUniversal.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“These things are always been sold very bespoke with these big sponsorship models, and they will continue to be sold that way, for people that want to like full takeover and everything,” adds Ryan McConville, executive VP of advertising platforms and operations. “But the ability to bid in dynamically to also get your message into those events is another thing … we’re really proud of because it’s sort of democratizing access [to live sports].”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Peacock is also planning to launch in-scene ads via a partnership with the ad tech firm TripleLift. When it launches, the service will allow for the insertion of signage and 3D products directly into scenes in Peacock programming.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We’re in Build mode right now with them for this product to and our plan is that it not only is you know, perfect and pristine for the consumer, but that it can scale and that the machine learning for finding where the placements should be, are top notch,” says Jenny Burke, executive VP of advertising strategy. “In-stream product placement, virtual private placement into streaming, we believe in it but it needs to be done really well in order to be able to scale.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And Burke says that Peacock is also deploying a new format that bears a resemblance to something DVD box set collectors are already familiar with: Behind-the-scenes commentary.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Peacock’s version, “Watch With,” will let users watch episodes of their favorite shows as the cast members, writers and directors give commentary on the episode, and answer live questions. Marketers will be able to sponsor the format.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There’ll be live commentary, Q&A, within the Peacock product feature with those stars while you watch that episode,” Burke says. “And we’ll have the marketer showcased there with us to get involved in that fandom with the consumer.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Peacock’s ad push comes as the environment for ad-supported streaming gets more and more crowded. In the last three months both Netflix and Disney+ launched ad-supported tiers, expanding the total market. While many advertisers will buy across many platforms, innovations like new programmatic options or unique sponsored ad opportunities can help a streaming service stand out.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">NBCUniversal is also <a href=#>part of a group</a> that includes Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and TelevisaUnivision in a Joint Industry Committee looking to unify around multiple currencies for the 2024 upfront. The company will hold a panel that includes its rivals at its One23 conference.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But another piece of that puzzle is a plan to pool streaming viewership data. The result could be a system in which HBO Max, Peacock, Paramount+, ViX+ and other streaming services could unify around definitions (like, for example, what’s a “view”?), and could allow for apples to apples comparisons, audited by a third-party, a far cry from today’s marketplace, where companies are holding tightly onto their streaming data.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We all have our streaming properties, and there’s a real need and demand to aggregate and bring transparency to to those audiences, transparency to that environment,” says Kelly Abcarian, executive VP of measurement and impact. “How are we collectively going to bring together a set of data so that I can see your data and you can see my data, no different than how linear works today.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmp5qTqruqwsSrqpqkXaWyoq%2FOnKJmmZSrsrPAyKygp59dmK6xrcGio6KsmZrAbn2RbGxsamBpgnR7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rich-piana-net-worth-2024-at-death.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rich Piana Net Worth 2024 At Death</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./movies-starring-dave-bautista.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Movies starring Dave Bautista</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
