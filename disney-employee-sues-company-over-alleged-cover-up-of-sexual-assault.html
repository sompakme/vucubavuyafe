Disney and Gonzales didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The plaintiff, suing as a Jane Doe, alleges that Gonzales assaulted her several times in 2017 through the use of ecstasy and a date rape drug, raping her when she was incapacitated. He also “used his position of power and blackmail” to force her to have sex with him, according to the complaint. When she tried to cut contact with him in 2018, Gonzales allegedly threatened to release intimate videos of their encounters and “ruin her career.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The accuser claims she wasn’t Gonzales’ “first victim nor his last” and that his history of sexual misconduct was well-known by management, which allegedly refused to properly investigate or take punitive action against him for years.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Women were discouraged to come forward about his behaviors because management seemingly accepted Gonzales’ conduct as being part of the entertainment industry and his firing would hurt the company financially,” states the complaint.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to the complaint, Gonzales stepped down in 2022 after three other women reported him for sexual harassment. The plaintiff, meanwhile, claims she was demoted last year in an alleged attempt by Disney to retaliate against her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Disney used the rolling layoffs as an excuse to demote Plaintiff and to place her on a different team where she did not manage any direct reports,” the suit states. “Previously, Plaintiff was a supervisory level employee who trained and directed three subordinates. Now, Plaintiff’s essential job duties are much smaller in scope and are similar to duties she performed at Disney ten years ago.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The complaint, which also names Searchlight and 20th Century, brings claims for sexual harassment, sexual assault and battery and negligence, among other claims relating to Disney’s alleged cover-up of Gonzales’ misconduct. It was brought under California’s Sexual Abuse and Cover Up Accountability Act, which revived the statute of limitations for claims seeking to recover damages suffered as a result of sexual assault for one year. Despite the window closing Dec. 31, the court may choose to advance the suit since that day and Jan. 1 were court holidays.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Disney is facing mounting legal concerns. A judge last month <a href=#>certified</a> a class of nearly 9,000 workers suing the company for discrimination against female workers, who say they’re being paid less than their male counterparts. It’s believed to be one of the largest classes ever suing under an equal pay act claim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnaGjo7K6ecSmp6WnqZqybr%2FUnqpmmZyhsqixw2aaqK6Vp3q2vIyonWarla3CoriMmqqsmaWhwW59kWxscG9pZX51ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dj-drama-previews-nipsey-hussle-collab-on-i-m-really-like-that-album.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>DJ Drama Previews Nipsey Hussle Collab On &amp;quot;I'm Really Like That&amp;quot; Album</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./corey-seager-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Corey Seager Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
