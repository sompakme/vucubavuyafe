In fact, it’s clinically proven to hydrate skin for up to 72 hours after applying, so you can slather it on knowing that you’re treating your skin to days (and days) of healthy, happy skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Undaria seaweed, shea butter, ceramides | <strong>Scent:</strong> Citrus | <strong>Size: </strong>6.7 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-nivea-cocoa-butter-body-cream-with-deep-nourishing-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nivea Body Cream</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NIVEA Cocoa Butter Body Cream with Deep Nourishing Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/g1K40WbasCUE8KHTlyS2LsUwUGc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nivea-1ea4e722026e4edfad3f59a5e340e566.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s easy to spread and massage into skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The scent is polarizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For roughly the same amount as an artisanal drink at your local coffee shop, you can score a whole pound of this cocoa butter-based formula, which offers 48 hours of moisture; that makes it one of the most cost-effective options on this list. Along with cocoa butter and vitamin E—which do much of the heavy lifting in terms of nourishing skin—it contains Nivea's Deep Moisture Serum for an added hydration boost.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Better yet, while this <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drugstore body lotion</a> feels thick and therefore super-satisfying to apply, it doesn't leave a sticky or tacky residue on skin.

(Don't worry: It won't stain or give skin a blue look once you apply it.) And since it's free of synthetic fragrances, sulfates, parabens, phthalates, and mineral oil, you can slather it on without worry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Japanese indigo, squalane, glycerin | <strong>Scent:</strong> Citrus floral | <strong>Size: </strong>0.28 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-aging-skin-caudalie-vinotherapist-replenishing-vegan-body-butter></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Aging Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Caudalie Vinotherapist Replenishing Vegan Body Butter</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Caudalie Vinotherapist Replenishing Vegan Body Butter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/15he9c3oDTutimDcKEHa-DcuAA4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/caudalie-vinotherapist-replenishing-vegan-body-butter-a69315de7fb64cf58fe474dc51d6bc59.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It can alleviate not just dryness, but the itchiness associated with it.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The scent recently changed, and some people hate it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This body butter is so good that it has a reputation that precedes it, says Dr. Farhang. “I love that it is formulated with shea butter, grape seed oil and date oil,” she says. Since skin loses its ability to retain moisture with age, this vegan formula—which replenishes the skin barrier to soften and soothe—keeps it hydrated, radiant, and youthful. In fact, it can even alleviate itchiness caused by dry skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Castilla is also a fan. “This is a rich formulation that still works easily into the skin and does not leave a greasy residue—and the fragrance is light,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Grapeseed oil, shea butter, date oil | <strong>Scent:</strong> Light grape | <strong>Size: </strong>8.5 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-pregnancy-mutha-body-butter></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Pregnancy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mutha Body Butter</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mutha Body Butter" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JKjQWJ-cIcH8zfzNYip2y3OnOE0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/MUTHA-Body-Butter-667268c60cda4a9aaeccd0ab2ee88299.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Violet Grey</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The brand donates a portion of profits to the International Medical Corps.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The extremely thick formula takes a bit of massaging to work it in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the name doesn't give it away, the brand was born when its founder was pregnant and seeking luxury, plant-based beauty products. To that end, this body butter is infused with 100 percent natural-origin ingredients, including shea, cocoa, and mango butters. Inside, you'll also find vitamin A, vitamin E, and fatty acids, which can help comfort and moisturize skin as it stretches during pregnancy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Bonus: The formula is also clinically proven to improve the discoloration of stretch marks and improve skin firmness.

And, unlike other body butters, it comes in a tube, making it easier for travel and more hygienic than a tub.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It locks in moisture for all-day softness, and since it's free of both fragrance and any potentially irritating essential oils, those with sensitive skin can pile it on without worry. It does take a little more time for it to fully sink into skin, but it's a worthwhile trade-off when you consider all the perks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Shea butter, coconut oil, sodium hyaluronate | <strong>Scent:</strong> No added fragrance | <strong>Size: </strong>6.7 ounces</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-spf-supergoop-body-butter-spf-40></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best with SPF</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Supergoop!
