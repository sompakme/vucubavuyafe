With 10 million sales and some of the most recognisable 90s R&B tracks behind them (Hold On, Don't Let Go, You're Never Gonna Get It, Free Your Mind), they set the bar for future female vocal groups. Although they were often compared to The Supremes, En Vogue were a rare breed of band in that each member was lead singer material. No one ever became the designated Diana Ross.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite a seemingly revolving door of band members, its remaining line-up never stopped touring - and, unusually for a group who've been together for so long (they met in the late 80s), appetite for their live shows never waned. What's new for this highly skilled band - which today comprises founding members Terry Ellis and Cindy Herron, as well as Rhona Bennett - is that they're now releasing their first album in 14 years, Electric Café. While the band are reticent to call it a comeback, their new material does mean that they've returned in a bigger way than ever before.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There have been public spats, legal battles, unfinished albums and even a TV film; En Vogue have weathered numerous storms, refusing to give up on their mutual passion. Here, Terry Ellis reflects on the band's tumultuous history, the secret to music longevity, what it really means to be a diva and the 90s fashion trend she wishes had never happened.</p><img alt="En Vogue" title="En Vogue" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/en-vogue-1-1522943274.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>The original En Vogue line-up in 1992 - Terry Ellis, Cindy Herron, Dawn Robinson and Maxine Jones</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What makes En Vogue so relevant and unique today?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's 2018 - the year of the woman - and in this particular year everything just fell into place for us. Recording our record and releasing came at a very significant and powerful time for women.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What made you stage a comeback?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I wouldn't call it a comeback because we never left. We've been consistently working, with barely a day off, for 27 years. We've been consistently touring. But it's just this specific moment in time that everything happened for us - we got a new manager, all of our music came together, we have the right combination of songs, we landed the right partnership with E1 Records. That's why it might it may seem like a comeback, but we wouldn't call it that - we'd call it a great plan and a great execution of a plan."</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What makes Electric Café different to your previous work?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"An eclectic blend of music simply because our initial intention was to do an EDM or dance record because we'd never done that before. But over the creative process, it started to take a life of its own. Because we have such an eclectic background of music, all of that came together. There's some R&B, a little bit of punk, soul and a little funk. We've got the signature En Vogue harmonies, but there are two songs on the album where me and the girls are singing in unison which is something we've never done before."</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">How have you overcome the challenges of having different band members?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"By continuing to work. Cindy and I did that not only because of our love of music and recording, but because of our passion. It was important for us to carry on the brand and the legacy that was created. Vocally, it was a bit challenging at first because of the signature harmonies. But because we continued to work with new producers, then it became easy. So it was our love for this brand and its legacy that we wanted to carry on."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What are your fondest memories of the 90s?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Shucks, I'd say receiving the Sammy Davis Jr award, the fashion of the 90s, doing the Soul Train awards and paying tribute to Patti LaBelle, Gladys Knight and Chaka Khan. The emotions of that night… that was a cool tribute that we did. Then The Lady Soul Awards, receiving the Image Awards - there's so many moments I can't ever name all of them."</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What was the worst 90s fashion trend?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"To me, wearing your label on the outside of your clothes. That was hideous to me."</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">Do you have any style regrets from that period?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I don't have any style regrets because we have an incredible stylist and he kept us well fit. In fact, some of the clothes he styled us in during the 90s still work in 2018."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What have you been doing in the interim?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We've been consistently touring. Cindy has four children - she's a mum and a wife. Rhona does life coaching. I am also a crafter, I have an arts and craft studio at my home. Quite honestly, we're on the road so much that we hardly get to do any of those things - with the exception of Cindy being a mum and you can't get away from that."</p><img alt="En Vogue" title="En Vogue" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/envogue2-1522943645.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>En Vogue on The Jay Leno Show in the early 90s</p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What's the biggest way that the music industry has changed since you started out?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's gone completely digital. When we were recording, we were on the cusp of analogue moving into digital. Now it's completely digital. Everything has a social media platform. Thankfully, because we were on the cusp and because we never stopped working, we were able to evolve with the time. We're there now and we were able to grow into the digital world with everyone else - which is another thing I think has helped us stay relevant."</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What does it take to be a modern diva?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Well, the true definition of a diva is a lead singer in theatre or the arts. It's only because we know the true meaning of that word that we allow ourselves to be called that. We all know that there are negative connotations to that title. So honestly, I don't know what it takes to be a modern diva; I guess to hone your craft and be a lead singer."</p><img alt="En Vogue" title="En Vogue" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ev-blue-dresses-1523002386.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-esp0ot e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Cindy Herron-Braggs, Terry Ellis and Rhona Bennett</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">Which artists do you like today?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Anderson Paak, Kendrick Lamar, all the greatest divas - we'll never get tired of them. Gladys Knight, Chaka khan, Natalie Cole, Patti LaBelle. Jill Scott. There's so many - it's hard for me to name everyone. We listen to Second Chance by Ed DeBarge all the time."</p><h2 data-node-id=32 class="body-h4 css-dmbyb0 emevuu60">What advice would you give to your younger self?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It would be the same advice that I've always given myself which is to focus, be respectful of yourself and others, know who you are and be true to yourself, operate with integrity and dignity.
