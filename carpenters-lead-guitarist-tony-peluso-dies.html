It was not uncommon for his Peluso family to entertain the likes of Les Paul or Jascha Heifetz.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>At 21, Peluso accepted an invitation to join the Carpenters, which turned into a 12-year gig. He traveled the world touring with Richard and Karen Carpenter and recorded many albums as their lead guitarist. Perhaps his most memorable work with the Carpenters was on the 1972 power ballad “Goodbye to Love,” where he conceived and played the masterful, melodic solo and outro.</p><p>The Carpenters will be honored at the Hollywood Bowl on June 18, the opening night of the season, and Richard Carpenter will perform.</p><p>After Karen Carpenter’s death in 1983, Peluso explored producing and engineering. He partnered for a decade with the head of A&R at Motown Records and co-produced dozens of records for such artists as Robinson, Jackson, the Temptations, the Four Tops and Sam Harris, the first winner of television’s “Star Search.”</p><p>During the 1980s and ’90s, Peluso also produced and/or engineered for artists such as Kenny Loggins, Seals & Crofts, Apollonia, Player, Animotion, Stephanie Mills, the Fixx, Dave Koz and Boyz II Men with Selena. He also was in demand as a session guitar player.</p><p>In 1992, Peluso began an association with two-time Academy Award winner Santaolalla. They pioneered the Latin genre known as Roc en Espanol, selling millions of records worldwide. Peluso also worked with such acclaimed Latin pop acts as Ricky Martin, Molotov and Cafe Tacuba.</p><p>In 2005, Santaolalla brought Peluso on board for the production of the soundtrack to “Brokeback Mountain”; its theme song, “The Wings,” won the 2005 Oscar for best original score.</p><p>Peluso continued to work with some of the best up and coming Latino singers and musicians.</p><p>Peluso is survived by sons Joe and Andrew. Services will be held at 11 a.m. on June 26 at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Northridge, Calif.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnJmipbKvwMSrqmaklZaxbrPUoquaqpmowW7AzqewZqiVocK0u4xra25pY2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cherie-chan-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cherie Chan Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./i-ve-thrown-away-my-scales-lucy-mecklenburgh-talks-diet-and-fitness.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'I've thrown away my scales!': Lucy Mecklenburgh talks diet and fitness</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
