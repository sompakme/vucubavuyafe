Oh well, there are not too much varieties but you are sure to get amazing, quality flavors that will keep you asking for more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7eq1pqork14.jpg><p>You can always get a not- too-expensive scoop in Ice cream factory compared to other ice-cream joints in Lagos.

The ice creams are creamy with the ice cream cones almost as delicious as the ice cream itself.</p><p><strong>7. Cream slices cake and desserts:</strong> This is a ‘go to’ place for ice cream lovers who desire varieties and not the typical chocolate and vanilla ice-cream.
