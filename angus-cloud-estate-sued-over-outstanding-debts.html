Plaintiffs include Cloud's manager Diomi Cordero, who is reportedly owed over $94,000, and Verizon, who is reportedly owed over $4,000. These suits list Cloud's mother Lisa as the primary defendant as she is the sole executor of her son's estate.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Cloud died last year as a result of an accidental overdose. Cloud passed away on July 31, less than a week after he buried his father in Ireland. "It is with the heaviest heart that we had to say goodbye to an incredible human today. As an artist, a friend, a brother and a son, Angus was special to all of us in so many ways. Last week he buried his father and intensely struggled with this loss. The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend. Angus was open about his battle with mental health, and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence," his family wrote in a statement at the time.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-angus-cloud-memorialized-with-mural>Angus Cloud Memorialized With Mural</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, soon after his death, Cloud's local community came out to give the actor a moving tribute. Local Oakland artist Darin Balaban teamed up with a group of Cloud's friends to create a touching tribute to the late actor. Working on the side of a car wash, Balaban created a nine-foot mural inspired by three photos of Cloud provided by his friends. Balaban, who also knew Angus, said that Cloud was "always smiling and calm". One of Cloud's best friends Kalani is also an artist and reportedly helped Balaban with the mural.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to TMZ, the mural painting became something of a community wake. People provided beer and pizza as they swapped stories about Cloud. However, Balaban admitted that he was surprised at how quickly the mural, located at Park and E. 19th, became a gathering place for those looking to mourn.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
