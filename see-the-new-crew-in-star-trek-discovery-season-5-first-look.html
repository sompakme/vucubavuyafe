According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook</a>, the streamer has unveiled a new trailer for the upcoming season, which was introduced during the Star Trek Universe panel at New York Comic Con by show star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonequa Martin-Green</a>, who portrays the first Black female Captain in the entire franchise. The trailer clocks in at just under a minute in length, but it gives us our first look at new characters Rayner, portrayed by Callum Keith Rennie, Moll, played by Eve Harlow, and L’ak, who is played by Elias Toufexis.</p><p>Rennie will be featured as a new <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series</a> regular on Star Trek: Discovery Season 5; his character, Rayner, is an intelligent, no-bull type of guy who draws a line between commander and crew, meaning he’s a leader and not a follower. He’s driven by his mission, and he refuses to play nice when it comes to getting the job done. Rayner isn’t team-oriented, however, he’s willing to collaborate with others for the greater good.</p><p>Previously a messenger, Harlow’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">character</a> on Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 is now an outlaw. She’s clever, witty, and extremely dangerous, and she approaches each situation with a clear objective, maintaining concentration even when things take a turn for the worst. When it comes to getting her way, Moll will go head-to-head with anyone, whether it’s Captain Burnham or the crew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/star-trek-discovery-season-4-900x506.jpg><p>On Star Trek: Discovery Season 5, Toufexis’ L’ak was also previously a courier and is now an outlaw, who is resilient and will do just about anything to protect his dear partner, Moll. Her safety is his number one priority, and so long as she’s out of harm’s way, L’ak isn’t concerned with collateral damage or its ramifications. Like Moll, he can be incredibly dangerous, and when faced with conflict, he finds himself on the opposing side of Captain Burnham and his crew.</p><p>After uncovering a mystery, Captain Burnham and company find themselves on an incredible adventure across the galaxy in Star Trek: Discovery Season 5. They’re determined to seek out an ancient power that’s been concealed for centuries, but they aren’t the only ones after said power. Burnham and company encounter dangerous enemies during their mission, who will stop at nothing to acquire the power for themselves.</p><p>Star Trek: Discovery Season 5 stars Sonequa Martin-Green, Doug Jones, Emily Coutts, Callum Keith Rennie, Eve Harlow, Elias Toufexis, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Anthony Rapp</a>, who’s been in the news quite a bit lately due to his recent court appearance, where he stated his claims before a New York City jury that Academy Award-winning actor, Kevin Spacey, sexually abused him during a party at his Upper East Side apartment in 1986 when Rapp was just 14 years old. Rapp first came forward with his allegations approximately five years ago and since opening up about the incident, several other individuals have accused the American Beauty star of sexual misconduct.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irpJa%2FbsDRnqJmnJmosLDCxKuwZquVlsCwuoxuZKedp2Kws7HWZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tara-reid-bio-age-net-worth-husband-movies-plastic-surgery.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tara Reid bio: age, net worth, husband, movies, plastic surgery</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./neve-campbell-net-worth-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Neve Campbell Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
