Yes, really! Felicity, a London-based agent at Curtis Brown, is more private than her husband and sister (you know, since they're celebrities and public figures and all), but she's publicly very supportive of both, and sometimes even amateur camerawoman to some of their shenanigans.</p><h2 id=felicity-is-close-with-her-sister-emily-3>Felicity is close with her sister, Emily.</h2><p>Felicity is fiercely supportive of Emily, even joining her on the red carpet and at events:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SE2yxkXnTxWLdJPpULG5yd-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78pftH8nFnR9WV2xqmo4Ke-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n9MxUsmThwcdabC23ZV7Uk-1920-80.jpg><p>If you needed more proof of their strong bond: Felicity&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://twitter.com/felicityblunt/status/1061732457949597696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dieclaire.com%2Fcelebrity%2Fa26114333%2Fwho-is-felicity-blunt%2F" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>tweets about her sister</a>&nbsp;all the time:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>15 years on...!

The pair met at Emily's wedding to John Krasinski at George Clooney's Lake Como home in 2010 (as you do), and hit it off. Felicity and Stanley's wedding in 2012 sounds like an incredibly star-studded affair: Attendees included Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Steve Buscemi, who was Stanley's best man.</p><p>Stanley gave us a glimpse into their home life in an Instagram drink-making video:</p><p>Felicity, who's manning the camera, laughs while her husband cracks jokes and mixes one of his signature drinks, and then the camera cuts to Stanley's "helpers" Emily and Krasinski (who are helping by eating the garnishes, apparently).

"So I did the movie, and she started treatments, and then we had the premiere, and then she was alive for four more years after that."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9ApaCLyM8Vm6G7eaX887S-1920-80.jpg><p>He added, "But that's where I met Emily and we became friends...And, actually, Felicity—Emily's sister, my wife—she and Kate talked at the premiere that night and I have a photo of them together, which is so odd.

I felt guilty. It’s horrible.” His feelings were heightened by the fact that he re-met Felicity relatively soon after Kate's death. "There are photographs around at home. Not that many, but I would have difficulty,” he told&nbsp;The Times. “And especially when we first met, it was only two years after Kate died.”</p><p>In 2021, Stanley spoke openly that he still grieves for his wife: "It’s still hard after 11 years...and it always will be hard. But you can’t let it—and she would never want any of us to—to wallow in that grief and let it take over our lives. She would never want that. She wasn’t like that."&nbsp;</p><p>Although the pair are very private about their kids, Felicity occasionally shares a teeny tiny bit about her (adorable) home life:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Every time I ask my two year old what she did at nursery (she’s the only person I know with a social life) she says DANCIN’!!! https://t.co/LaQU2kR33K<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/felicityblunt/status/1356340771083997185 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>February 1, 2021</a></p><h2 id=felicity-is-a-powerhouse-literary-agent-at-curtis-brown-3>Felicity is a powerhouse literary agent at Curtis Brown.</h2><p>Blunt is a literary agent at&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/agent/felicity-blunt referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>UK agency Curtis Brown</a>, where she landed after training to be a barrister.
