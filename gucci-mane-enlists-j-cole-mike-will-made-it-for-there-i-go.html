He is always giving his fans a lot to enjoy, and you can't help but admire that. Moreover, he is always giving new artists opportunities, which is also great to see. At this point in his career, he <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">has become a mentor to so many</a>. Although, when it comes to his own music, he is far from finished.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Soon, the artist will be dropping a new album called Breath Of Fresh Air. Numerous singles from this project have already dropped. That said, Gucci Mane is not finished with the new tracks. Earlier this week, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">it was teased that he would be dropping a single</a> with the likes of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a>. Moreover, the song would carry production from none other than Mike WiLL Made-It.
