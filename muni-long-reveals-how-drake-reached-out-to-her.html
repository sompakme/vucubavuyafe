In fact, if you were to check to do some research and check her resume, you would discover that she is responsible for some of the biggest songs over the past ten years, such as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chris Brown</a>’s "Don’t Wake Me Up" and Fifth Harmony’s “Worth It.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">But the acclaimed singer/songwriter is finally getting her shot in the spotlight as "Hrs and Hrs" has become a viral hit, garnering attention from fans across social media and in the music industry. Hence, it’s only right she makes her appearance on Ebro Darden’s R&B Radio Now on Apple Music 1 to discuss her breakout single. But during the interview mentioned above, Muni Long revealed some exciting information regarding <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> and her relationship before either of them blew up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/82/42/344282_7f52dad5a63e6870778ea69bae585c70.jpg><p><h6>(Jerritt Clark/Getty Images for Femme It Forward)</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition, she detailed her rise to fame, discussing how she started writing music and playing the guitar and her first taste of virality through song covers that she would create, but it was the third instance of viral success that stunned her. When she created a cover of Drake’s "Best I Ever Had" that featured her singing instead of rapping, the song garnered millions of views of positive reactions, including a call from Drake himself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“So that Drake reached out to me. And he was like, “Yo, I love what you did with the song.” He gave me his number, we’re talking. Mind you now, I’m just out of high school. You know?,” asked the Vero Beach native. “And I was watching him on Degrassi when I was in middle school and high school. So I’m like, “Oh my God, this is Aubrey Graham. This is amazing! Wheelchair Jimmy.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Long revealed that during this time, Drake was trying his best to make the transition from an actor to a rapper and had just finished wrapping up work on his now-iconic mixtape, So Far Gone, saying, “And so, I remember talking to him back then. And he’s like, “Yeah, I’m an actor. I’m trying to get into music. I did this mixtape for Valentine’s Day. Didn’t really take it serious,” said the singer to R&B Now Radio on Apple Music 1 as she began to describe how she got signed in the middle of all of this.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/16/75/567516_bfc3dc32418a9fa74bbd685e7878fe81.png><p><h6>&nbsp;(Image via R&B Now Radio on Apple Music 1)</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“People love it. I’m singing. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a> wants to sign me. So, I mean, and not just him. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Fantasia</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Pharrell</a> ... So many people because my videos were spreading all over the internet. And from there, I fast forward a couple of years; I got signed to Capitol Records about 18 years old.” It’s always fascinating to see how far artists have come when you look back at their careers, especially when they’ve been in the game longer than we think.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Muni Long has been in the game as long as Drake with their working relationship since 2009; when we fast forward to 2022, and you observe how much success both artists have garnered, it’s truly amazing. And it doesn't seem like either of them are slowing down any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZYBxhZJmpK6mmWK5sLrGZqmerpWWubR5x6iuZpyilrimedGemJyglZl6sMHTZquoZZiav266xLCq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./three-aldi-items-for-valentine-s-day-starting-at-4-they-re-not-all-sweet-treats-but-worth-the-tri.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Three Aldi items for Valentine's Day starting at $4 - they're not all sweet treats but worth the tri</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lil-uzi-vert-to-host-philadelphia-eagles-super-bowl-victory-party.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lil Uzi Vert To Host Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl Victory Party</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
