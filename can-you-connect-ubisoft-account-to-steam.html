Here are some frequently asked questions about linking Ubisoft and Steam accounts:</p><h3>How do I link my Ubisoft account to Steam?</h3><p>To link your Ubisoft account to Steam, follow these steps:<br>1.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the linking process.</p><h3>Can I transfer Ubisoft games to Steam?</h3><p>No, it is not possible to transfer Ubisoft games from Steam to Ubisoft Connect or vice versa.

If you are logged into a different Ubisoft account on Ubisoft Connect PC, Steam will prompt you for a game key.</p><h3>Can Steam players play with Ubisoft Connect players?</h3><p>Yes, when playing a game through Ubisoft Connect PC, you can join multiplayer games with your Ubisoft Connect friends, even if they purchased the game through another approved retailer like Steam or the Epic Games Store.</p><h3>How do I merge my Ubisoft accounts?</h3><p>It is not possible to merge two Ubisoft accounts or combine the Units and XP on them. Each Ubisoft account is separate and cannot be linked together.</p><h3>Can you link Ubisoft accounts?</h3><p>Yes, you can link your Ubisoft accounts to other platforms. To link your accounts, follow these steps:<br>1. Log in to the Account Information webpage on Ubisoft’s website.<br>2. Scroll down to the Linked accounts section.<br>3. Select “Link” under the logo of the platform you want to connect and follow the on-screen instructions.</p><h3>Can I redeem a Ubisoft key on Steam?</h3><p>No, if you do not have a Steam key, it is not possible to redeem a Ubisoft key on Steam.

If you are logged into a different Ubisoft account on Ubisoft Connect PC, you may be prompted for a game key.</p><h3>Can you buy a game on Steam and get a key?</h3><p>Some Steam games may provide you with an additional activation key once they have been downloaded on a Steam account. You can find these keys in your Steam library by right-clicking on the game and selecting “Manage” and then “CD Keys.”</p><h3>What happens if I redeem a Steam key for a game I already have?</h3><p>If you redeem a Steam key for a game you already own, you will receive an error message stating that your account already owns the product associated with the key.</p><h3>Can I transfer my Ubisoft account?</h3><p>In some cases, it is possible to transfer ownership of a Ubisoft game from one Ubisoft account to another. However, other in-game content such as rewards, challenges, achievements, or progress cannot be transferred.</p><h3>Is my Ubisoft account cross-platform?</h3><p>Yes, your Ubisoft account is cross-platform. You can start playing a game on one PC and continue your progression on another PC as long as you log into the same Ubisoft account. Rainbow Six Siege also supports crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox consoles as well as between PC and Luna platforms.</p><h3>What does linking Ubisoft accounts do?</h3><p>When you link a platform account to your Ubisoft account, a permanent link is created between both accounts. This allows for crossplay and cross-progression between platforms. However, unlinking external accounts can have a permanent impact on your games due to the mechanics of crossplay and cross-progression.</p><h3>How do I transfer games from my Ubisoft account?</h3><p>To transfer a game from your Ubisoft account, you will need to open a support case from the Ubisoft account the game is currently registered on. You will also need to provide a valid proof of purchase with your case. Please note that for technical reasons, only the game activation can be transferred.</p><h3>What happens when you link your Ubisoft account?</h3><p>When you link your Ubisoft account to another platform account, a permanent link is created between both accounts.
