By the time <a href=# class=text-word rel>Tank</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ginuwine</a>, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Tyrese</a> joined together to form TGT in 2007, they each had amassed success as individual artists. The <a href=# rel>collaborative&nbsp;effort was well-received </a>by R&B lovers and soon, the trio was taking to stages and being nominated for awards. They would go on to release their introductory record in 2013, but their entire run was fraught with conflicts.</p><p>Each artist was signed to different labels so figuring things out behind the scenes proved to be difficult. Releases were delayed or put on hold, and while TGT did continue to perform live shows together,<a href=# rel> sharing music</a> was impossible.</p><p>Jason Kempin / Staff / Getty Images</p><p>Each&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel>singers has shared their perspective</a>s over the years, including Tank who had a fallout with Tyrese. During his recent appearance on Drink Champs,&nbsp;Tank addressed the conflict and revisited that time in his career.</p><p>“What happened the first time around is we fought to make that album. It was a hell of a process. Literally, the only thing that kept me from fighting Tyrese was J. Valentine, my manager,” Tank said. “That was just two alphas. Me and Ty are both Capricorns, and we bumped heads every step of the way... That’s my brother, so I can say that. I just felt like<a href=# rel> he was doing too much</a>.”</p><p>He also touched on&nbsp;why they haven't given&nbsp;TGT another go.</p><p>“What I think is happening right now is, as stressful as that process was, nobody feels like they have to inconvenience themselves anymore to do it. And I blame that on people being rich, Tyrese is rich, Ginuwine is rich. Do they need TGT? No. Doesn’t matter to them, but the R&B universe needs TGT."</p><p>Watch Tank on Drink Champs below.</p><p></p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZ4NxgJBmq5qmm2LBsMHCoZysZZ%2BjerWz02admqScpMK1edaiq6FlpK6%2Fpr%2FEZp%2BeZaeWwG6wzqKloGWkpLxuudScn2amlazA</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./this-is-how-redd-foxx-really-got-his-name.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>This Is How Redd Foxx Really Got His Name</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-celebrates-birthday-with-cryptic-post.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna Celebrates Birthday With Cryptic Post</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
