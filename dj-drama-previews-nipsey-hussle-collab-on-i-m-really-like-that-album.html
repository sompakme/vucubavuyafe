The rapper was shot and killed in his stomping grounds in L.A. on March 31st, 2019. Fans and friends have kept his name alive since then, while many have sought justice against the man who murdered Nip in broad daylight. Last week, a judge <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">handed down a 60-year to a life sentence to Eric Holder </a>for the death of Nip. Though many expressed relief, it doesn’t bring Nipsey Hussle back.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Since his passing, fans have cherished Nipsey’s catalog even more. He released a handful of classic mixtapes throughout his career and only dropped one album, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Victory Lap</a>. From his early bangers to the Grammy-nominated, “Racks In The Middle,” Nipsey Hussle boasts a timeless catalog. However, there have been very few updates surrounding any posthumous releases. His family hasn’t shared any plans to drop unreleased records, though he’s posthumously appeared on a few singles alongside legends like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay-Z</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dr. Dre</a>.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dj-drama-previews-nipsey-hussle-track><a href=# class=text-word>DJ Drama</a> Previews Nipsey Hussle Track</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It seems like another posthumous record from Nipsey Hussle might be coming soon. This week, DJ Drama hit fans with a preview of a verse from Nip that will presumably land on the DJ’s next album. The verse itself, however, isn’t actually new, despite claims that the verse is unreleased. Drama reused Nip’s verse from 2016’s “State Of Mind” for the record, which he described as being a big tune on his upcoming project, I’m Really Like That.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">DJ Drama and Nipsey Hussle are no strangers to each other. Prior to the release of Victory Lap, Nip linked up with Drama for the third part of the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Marathon</a> series, Crenshaw. Unfortunately, we didn’t get many collaborations from them since then. If Nip was still with us today, it would’ve been amazing to see how he would’ve approached a Gangsta Grillz mixtape. Nonetheless, we’re excited to hear what Drama has cooking up on his forthcoming album. Check the snippet above and sound off with your thoughts in the comments.&nbsp;We'll keep you posted on anymore updates surrounding DJ Drama's upcoming project, I'm Really Like That.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
