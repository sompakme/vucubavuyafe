But his personal life has had some scandals, which have been known as the years have passed, for example, in his relationship with <strong>Karen Beltran</strong>, mother of his daughter, <strong>Emily Cinnamon</strong>, of whom the fighter from Guadalajara, Mexico, acknowledged that there were times when he had no money to buy diapers.</p><p>Currently, the problem is solved, as the fighter organized a party in luxury for his eldest daughter. But when he was beginning to be successful in boxing, Canelo was romantically involved with a beautiful host, <strong>Marisol González</strong>, who was almost his wife, a little more than a decade ago, when he was 20 years old and she was 27.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Canelo recovering from left hand surgery</span><span class=ue-c-article__media-author><span>@Canelo</span></span></p></figure><p>However, at that time, the relationship, which was supposedly going very well, suddenly broke up and everyone went their own way. Just a few days ago, the hostess, also originally from <strong>Guadalajara</strong>, revealed the details that led to the breakup.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Marisol Gonzalez's version and her breakup with Canelo Alvarez</h2><p>During an interview with journalist <strong>Mara Patricia Castañeda</strong>, the actress and host explained that the romance took place in 2010 and that the cause of the breakup was the age difference, even though she assured that the fighter was a very mature person for his age and, although they no longer have contact, both remember each other fondly.</p><p>The then known as "<strong>Chica Televisa Deportes</strong>" told that she met Canelo during an event in Puebla and later was assigned to cover the activities of the then young fighter, so they initially exchanged phone numbers and from there a friendship arose.</p><figure class="ue-c-article__media ue-c-article__media--video ue-c-article--media-icon-m-from-tablet" readability=1><p><span class=ue-c-article__media-description>Canelo Álvarez with his daughter Emily celebrating her birthday</span></p></figure><p>Then, he asked her out on a date and that's how their courtship began. However, she explained that during the relationship that they broke up several times, due to the differences between them. In spite of everything, Saul Alvarez gave her an engagement ring, one day when he surprised her in <strong>Mexico City</strong>, but she was aware that the age difference would be a determining factor to stay together.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>Marisol Gonzalez's fears with Canelo Alvarez</h2><p>She explained that she felt fear because <strong>Canelo</strong> still had a long way to go and his career was just heading to the top.</p><p>In fact, he revealed that he does not know where the jewel is, because, although she tried to return it on several occasions, he never received it back, so he believes that maybe the driver's mother still has the piece.</p><p></p><p>She also acknowledged that they both had good times and that when they broke up, she spent <strong>several weeks in depression</strong>.</p><p>After breaking up with Canelo, Marisol met soccer player <strong>Rafael Márquez Lugo</strong> and then began their relationship, which bore fruit with a baby girl. While Canelo has a formal relationship with model and businesswoman <strong>Fernanda Gómez</strong>, with whom he has two children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jpumsaGenHxzfJFrZmpoX2eFcIKSbpltamlqf3eExGyca3FnbIWjgJRwZ2egpKK5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./derek-webster-actor-wiki-biography-age-height-wife-family-net-worth-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Derek Webster (Actor) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Family, Net Worth &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-boxing-hand-wraps-2023-tried-and-tested.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best boxing hand wraps 2023, tried and tested</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
