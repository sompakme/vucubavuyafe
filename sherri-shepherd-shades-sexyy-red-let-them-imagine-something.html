The 25-year-old hitmaker is known for her <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">raunchy songs</a> and laid-back persona, and it's safe to say that her music isn't for everyone. Lyrics to tracks like "Pound Town" and "Looking For The Hoes" are enough to incite gasps from even the most open-minded listeners, including Shepherd.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to Shepherd, she just can't get behind the St. Louis-born performer's explicit lyrics. "Oh my God, I was like <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"what are these girls talking about nowadays?"</a> she says of hearing "Pound Town" for the first time. "When did talking about your booty hole start being sexy to people?" As for whether or not Shepherd would be willing to have Sexyy Red as a guest on SHERRI, it looks like another 'no' from her.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-sherri-shepherd-doesn-t-want-sexyy-red-on-her-show>Sherri Shepherd Doesn't Want Sexyy Red On Her Show</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"When did just getting money, and showing your booty hole to dudes become sexy</a>? Me, I come from the school of let them imagine something. Don't just come and show him every day," the personality continued. She then described how things have changed since she was Sexyy Red's age, noting how she doesn't get current trends. Shepherd says that although they had their fair share of "wild" music back in the day, they kept things balanced. She acknowledges that there are some current artists putting out wholesome tracks, but she doesn't think there are "enough."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shepherd's take on the "SkeeYee" artist has some fans up in arms, while other users understand where she's coming from. Obviously, everyone's entitled to their own opinions, and can listen to and support whoever they want. With that being said, many note that Sexyy Red has been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a major target</a> for criticism in recent months, despite her staying in her own lane.
