Police officially opened a case into her disappearance in late August, when a family member called to report she had vanished.</p><p>The case then took a very dark turn in mid-September, when the FBI was anonymously sent photographs showing Rainwater semi-nude and in a cage. The feds alerted local police to the tip and officers found seven similar photos on the phone of James D. Phelps, who is thought to be the last person to see Rainwater, the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Kansas City Star</a> reports. Phelps initially wound up on police radar two weeks before the alarming photo surfaced, when an investigator following a lead in Rainwater’s missing-persons case questioned him at his cabin. At that time, according to court records, Phelps claimed Rainwater had been staying with him “until she could get back on her feet.”</p><p>Both Phelps and Timothy Norton, a trucker who had been living on his property, are now in custody. They are charged with kidnapping Rainwater and inflicting injury and terrorizing, court records show.</p><p>Police said Norton admitted during questioning that he had helped restrain Rainwater, but his lawyer, Brandon Twibell, on Wednesday told local media that his client denies all the allegations. Phelps’ public defender has yet to comment on the charges.</p><p>The two suspects appeared via webcam on Tuesday before a Dallas County judge, who set a preliminary hearing in the case for Nov. 5.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rainwater’s fate—and her whereabouts—remain unknown. Police have largely kept whatever information they have about the case to themselves, citing the “extreme nature of the crime” in a Sept. 18 update.</p><p>They have been similarly tightlipped about the blaze that erupted at Phelps’ Windyville home late Monday. Fire crews responding to the scene arrived to find a tripwire and a “live incendiary device,” prompting the Springfield Fire Department’s bomb squad to scramble to the area, the Star reported.</p><p>Bomb squad technicians detonated the device early Tuesday. It was not immediately clear what caused the fire, and if it could have been sparked by an improvised device.</p><p>The mystery surrounding the case has ballooned to such proportions that out-of-towners have reportedly begun visiting the area where Rainwater was caged up—it has apparently not been secured by investigators.</p><p>One man quoted by the Star who had driven more than an hour just to look at the potential crime scene grimly noted that “these guys could have been pulling this off for years.”</p><p>Another onlooker, identified by the newspaper as Brian Anthony, said he expects the case to get even weirder.</p><p>“I think this is going to be a blown-up big deal when it’s finally done. I think when it’s all said and done, it’s going to blow people’s minds.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVfora0v86uqaJlna7AtbHRsmSorpWneqSt0qygnbFdp66qutaaq56qXaK2tL%2FIp55mr5%2Birq950qGmsKZdnrturYycmKCdXamurLHSZphmppWseqO12Zqpq51dqcSqv9M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mookie-betts-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mookie Betts Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michael-tilson-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael Tilson Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
