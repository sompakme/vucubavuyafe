"Chadian women discovered millennia ago that the seeds have powerful hair strengthening properties."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Master Cosmetologist and Global Education Manager at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Design Essentials</a> Alicia Bailey also boasts about the ingredient's benefits for hair. "It helps to reduce split ends and breakage, keeps the hair moisturized and extremely soft, and provides easier detangling which in turn helps with length retention," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ready to learn more about the superstar ingredient? Read on to discover everything you need to know about chebe.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-chebe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is chebe?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As previously mentioned, chebe is "a shrub that grows in the mountain ranges" of Chad, known for its hair strengthening abilities. So it's easy to see why it's been used by women in the country for centuries.,</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Petersen notes that while the ingredient has started to become increasingly popular in the west over the past few years, not all chebe powder is created equally.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The kind that has that effect on hair only grows in a specific region in Chad," she says. "I bought a few powders on Amazon and elsewhere on the internet — none of them were chebe. I don't know what it was — sand, henna, cigarette hash?" Yikes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why she says it's important to know where you're getting your chebe from — and who's a part of the sourcing process.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Beware of people selling 'African' chebe, as it is a whole different variety and has no effect whatsoever on hair," she warns.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-use-chebe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do you use chebe?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, the shrub is pulverized into a powder, then mixed with water, natural oils, and butters and applied to the hair. "[You can use] shea butter or kakar oil," Bailey shares. "Or [you can use a] carrier oil of choice, like sesame or coconut."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Traditionally, the Basara women of Chad gather and take turns applying the moisturizing paste into each other's strands, while braiding each saturated section. The mixture is then left in the hair for several days. However, for those of us in North America, if it's been a while since you've sat between your mother's knees, feel free to apply Petersen's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Chébé Du Tchad Hair Cream</a>, which was perfectly designed as a leave-in treatment.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The ritual of chebe is documented in prehistorical rock art paintings," she explains. "It has been long revered in Chad and passed down for generations. I learned about it from my mom and the women of my family." &nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-should-chebe-be-used></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How often should chebe be used?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Traditionally, chebe is applied to the hair two to three times a week. However, it can really be used as often as you'd like.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Some may opt to use it as a leave-in, or in oils or butters if they are unable to utilize it as the Basara women traditionally do," explains Bailey. "The Basara women often put it in their hair twice per week. They sometimes reapply the mixture every four days."<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-makes-chebe-beneficial-for-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What makes chebe beneficial for hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"By applying the paste to the hair and keeping the hair braided in plaits, it keeps the hair moisturized, and helps to retain length," says Bailey. This, in turn, also prevents damage and breakage, leading to healthier hair overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Lots of women, especially Black women with textured hair, feel their hair is not growing," says Petersen. "Their hair grows, it just breaks faster than it grows."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Petersen's line in particular has taken chebe to the next level by extracting the best the ingredient has to offer and putting it into her products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The proprietary patented extract I made out of my chebe seeds allow us unprecedented access to all the active molecules of the seed, hence multiplying its powers and repairing hair inside out, as if it was new," she explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-anyone-who-should-avoid-using-chebe></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is there anyone who should avoid using chebe?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those with fine hair may notice a weighed-down feeling, says Bailey. But otherwise, chebe is a universally-beneficial product, with only a few exceptions.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It may also be challenging for people with locks or protective styles to use traditional chebe powder as it can get tangled into the style and not rinse out properly," says Petersen. "But as long you have the authentic real deal from Chad, there are no contraindications. To be extra safe you can do a patch test, and of course, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended to seek your healthcare provider's advice."&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>All Natural</a>.&nbsp;From the kinkiest coils to loose waves, we're celebrating natural hair in its many forms by sharing expert tips for styling, maintenance, and haircare.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wqGcm51dna6qvoybnKedlp7BtHmVcW9xcWVq</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-burl-wood-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What is burl wood worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-15-best-body-butters-of-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The 15 Best Body Butters of 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
