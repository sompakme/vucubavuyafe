Patrice was a mother and hairdresser from Cumming, Georgia, who vanished from her hair salon within a 13-minute window on April 15, 2004. There was no trace of any struggle at the crime scene except for Patrice's uneaten lunch, and her car was parked unusually. Her remains were discovered 600 days later, on December 6, 2005, behind Lebanon Baptist Church in Dawson County. She left behind a&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a33079569/who-is-pistol-black-unsolved-mysteries/>son, Pistol Black,</a>&nbsp;and a husband, Rob Endres.</p><p>The cold case has left authorities stunned since 2004, and there remain almost no leads on what caused Patrice's death.

Jones told detectives he'd abducted and killed a hairdresser from a Georgia salon, telling authorities he murdered the woman and threw her body off a bridge into a creek. He even told police that some of her alleged final words: "She said she had a family that loved her very much. She started crying, which started to make me cry."</p><p>On the episode, Mobile County Sheriff's Office Capt. Paul Burch said that Jones' confession to the detectives about this woman's death includes details that only the killer of Patrice would've known. "I believe he's a strong possibility for Patrice's murder," said Burch.</p><p>But Jones ended up taking back his confession later that year, saying to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://abc3340.com/news/local/alabama-serial-killer-featured-in-unsolved-mysteries-reboot-on-netflix referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>NBC 15 News</a>, "There's detectives out there who've worked these cases for years and years, and they're so bound and determined to put me here, and put me there, and question me about this, and question me about that, ok?
