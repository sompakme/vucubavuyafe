Considered the gold standard in anti-aging and acne treatment, it promotes firmer skin, smoothes out fine lines and wrinkles, minimizes pores, evens out skin tone, and clears up blemishes. And from our experience, it really is that powerful.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite being a powerhouse, retinol can get a bit of a bad rap due to its potential for causing irritation — but that’s not to say you shouldn’t give it a go. What it all comes down to is choosing the right formula for your needs. There are hundreds of options available to you, ranging from serums and moisturizers to boosters and targeted treatments, all at a variety of price points, so there’s something out there for everyone. The only challenge is finding your perfect match.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Instead of spending hours of time doing research, rely on ours. We meticulously tested 32 of the best over-the-counter retinol formulas on the market for 12 weeks, rating each one for their absorption and consistency, as well as the effect it had on our skin, and final results it provided. We then cut down that list to the top-performing products.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-shani-darden-retinol-reform-treatment-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Shani Darden Retinol Reform Treatment Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Shani Darden Retinol Reform Treatment Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FV87RhnwlfKml-GpgGWLy-Gy5p4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shani-Darden-Retinol-Reform-Treatment-Serum-491361ea16ca4b1dad3f1f835611ddd5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of the 32 products we tested, Shani Darden’s cult-favorite retinol was the easiest to integrate into our routine thanks to its light, non-irritating formula that absorbed quickly and enhanced luminosity both instantly and over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ll be the first to admit that incorporating a potent skin active, like retinol, can be nerve wracking, regardless of skin type. While we’d used prescription-strength retinoids in the past to help treat our dry, acne-prone skin, we were still wary of this test, especially considering this product contained both retinol and exfoliating lactic acid.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To our surprise, the gentle gel-cream formula didn’t trigger any sensitivity and instead left our skin feeling soft and comfortable. After 12 weeks of testing, our skin looked practically poreless and more even —&nbsp;and our seriously acne-prone skin only developed one pimple during the entire trial period, which was a true first!&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we loved the serum’s creamier texture and how it didn’t strip our already-dry skin of moisture, we wish it had imparted a bit of extra nourishment. Regardless, it layered beautifully with our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>hydrating serums</a> and moisturizer, and we recommend this to anyone looking for a new retinol, whether they’re a seasoned user or new to the ingredient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong> </strong>|<strong> Active Ingredients: </strong>Encapsulated retinol, lactic acid, apple fruit extract |<strong> Retinol Concentration: </strong>2.2% |<strong> Size: </strong>1 oz&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-bybi-beauty-1-bakuchiol--olive-squalane-oil-booster></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BYBI Beauty Squalane Oil Booster</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BYBI Beauty 1% Bakuchiol + Olive Squalane Oil Booster" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/cDvy0HFT8epGdJ-NJ_Dq46uIYS0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bybi-beauty-1-bakuchiol---olive-squalane-oil-booster-629e5b169a024ccdb57a5f204fee9276.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This booster serum is a solid investment: Adding just a few drops of this to our favorite skin treatment transformed it into a skin-smoothing powerhouse that made our skin brighter and more hydrated by the end of our 12-week trial.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The clean, natural formula only contains two ingredients —&nbsp;99 percent olive-derived squalane and one percent sustainably harvested bakuchiol, which form a light oily texture that smoothed and firmed while simultaneously quenching our dry, thirsty skin. The booster is also fragrance-free, which we appreciated as we’ve experienced irritation from scented products in the past.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep in mind that the bottle is small, coming in at only half an ounce. Considering that the product is designed to be mixed into other formulas in our routine, we didn’t mind —&nbsp;and the fact that the booster isn't too expensive makes the small size justifiable in our book.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum<strong> </strong>| <strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Bakuchiol, squalane | <strong>Retinol Concentration: </strong>1% | <strong>Size: </strong>0.5 oz&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-the-inkey-list-supersolutions-1-retinol-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The INKEY List SuperSolutions 1% Retinol Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The INKEY List SuperSolutions 1% Retinol Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Wy3YQwam5GmMXhyX2xCs4ESfJcY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-inkey-list-supersolutions-1-retinol-serum-3661dbb123be4fad8a7f8c8ade73733b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our oily, acne-prone skin is extremely sensitive;&nbsp;in addition to being allergic to Neosporin, we’ve encountered many products that have caused adverse reactions. However, The INKEY List’s formula truly was a super solution that helped banish stubborn acne and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation with ease.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though it’s labeled as a serum, we found the rich texture (courtesy of squalane) to feel more like a moisturizer, making it easy to control during application. It absorbed instantly and didn’t pill, even when we sealed it under heavy, balm-like creams. Most importantly, our skin never had a bad reaction while using this and by the end of our 12-week testing period, we were still using the formula every other day in complete comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for results, we found that it cut our skin’s recovery time in half when healing from acne, even when we couldn’t resist the temptation of popping our pimples. Plus, stubborn dark marks faded in just a few days and left our skin looking smooth and radiant. We didn’t notice a change when it came to minimizing our forehead wrinkles, but if you don’t have many fine lines or wrinkles, this product is bound to become a staple in your routine.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Serum | <strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Retinol, apricot kernel oil, squalane | <strong>Retinol Concentration: </strong>1% | <strong>Size: </strong>1 oz&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dermatologist-recommended-cerave-resurfacing-retinol-serum></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dermatologist-Recommended</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5uUI0aAOJgzPVG7D9Bzd4859AH8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cerave-resurfacing-retinol-serum-ebe3bc511bb0475db7b90dac317a6415.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a relative retinol newcomer, CeraVe’s serum was both developed and approved by dermatologists, and we found that it kept our skin comfortable throughout the entirety of our 12-week testing period. We attribute this to the brand’s signature blend of nourishing ceramides and soothing niacinamide that warded off the typically harsh effects of retinol.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our goal in using this formula was to help fade scars and dark spots left behind from breakouts; the encapsulated retinol and brightening licorice root extract definitely helped to even out our skin tone, albeit subtly. It left our skin smoother and noticeably balanced, never exacerbating dryness or oiliness, and it absorbed nicely while playing well with other products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s worth noting that because all of CeraVe’s formulas are so gentle, this serum may not provide the dramatic results some people might be looking for from a retinol product.

Retinol goes through that process twice and with every conversion, the strength of the ingredient is diluted. But because this formula uses retinal, it’s stronger than your average retinol serum. We noticed this when assessing our results: We experienced fewer breakouts, as well as smaller pores and more radiant, even skin than we achieved previously with other retinol formulas. Though this retinal is strong, we didn’t observe any excessive dryness, likely due to the moisture-replenishing mix of mushroom extracts and ceramides.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Beware though, this retinal serum is not for first-time retinoid users because of its strength.

Its first ingredient is&nbsp;squalane, a rich emollient that helps combat the irritation associated with retinol, like redness and flaking. It lent the stick a somewhat oily texture that absorbed easily into our skin, leaving our complexion much more moisturized than any other retinols we’ve tried in the past. This product did trigger a purging period, often called the retinol uglies, on the most acne-prone area of our face —&nbsp;our jawline —&nbsp;but our skin completely cleared up towards the end of our trial period.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we didn’t notice a dramatic improvement to our fine lines and wrinkles, it’s possible that expression lines would continue to smooth out with continued use. After all, the stick has a high concentration of retinol as well as the plant-based alternative, bakuchiol. Don’t let the potent percentages scare you, though, as the moisturizing ingredients in the formula (like squalane and botanical oils) kept our skin soft and supple, which is why we think it would make a great retinol for beginners.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Stick | <strong>Active Ingredients: </strong>Encapsulated retinol, squalane, bakuchiol | <strong>Retinol Concentration: </strong>3% |<strong> Size: </strong>0.28 oz&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-drugstore-loreal-paris-revitalift-triple-power-anti-aging-moisturizer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Drugstore</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L’Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Moisturizer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L&amp;rsquo;Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Moisturizer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TK-raKbqeGkh6wgf1pqzUm-1J1w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-triple-power-anti-aging-moisturizer-fragrance-free-2a5ec05f62d64c109e39267c550707f6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Absorption</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Consistency</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Effectiveness</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Overall Results</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=3><p>It uses a retinol derivative that isn’t as potent as true retinol, meaning it’ll take much longer to see changes in fine lines, wrinkles, and dark spots.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we first incorporated this moisturizer into our routine, our goal was to come out of the 12-week testing period with more hydrated and nourished skin than when we started —&nbsp;and this well-priced product delivered.

We didn’t experience irritation at any point of our trial, which is rare when it comes to retinol. This effect is likely due to the specific type of retinol — a retinol derivative called pro-retinol — in the formula, which is known to work a little slower through the body, meaning you’ll be waiting a tad longer to see results.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After 12 weeks, our skin was well hydrated and plump, but we didn’t see much change to our fine lines or dark spots.

However, they’re not the same:&nbsp;While retinol has to go through a conversion process for skin to recognize it as retinoic acid, adapalene does not. That means this formula hasn’t been diluted and is extremely potent (which is why it was once available only through a dermatologist). If your skin hasn’t experienced and adjusted to a product of this strength before, you’ll likely face some irritation and dryness.

This goes for people of any skin type (which is why patch testing is so important), but it’s especially true of those with very sensitive skin types.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this has nothing to do with your skin type, you should not use retinol if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Instead, you can opt for formulas that contain plant-based retinol alternatives like bakuchiol, which you’ll find in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">BYBI Beauty 1% Bakuchiol + Olive Squalane Oil Booster</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Biossance Squalane + Phyto-Retinol Serum</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Retinol Concentration</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Retinol products come in a wide variety of concentrations, which simply refers to the potency of the ingredient in the formulation. “0.25 percent is the lowest strength both in the prescription form and in over-the-counter versions,” says Dr. Leipziger. “Dry, fragile, or thin skins should start with 0.25 percent on alternate nights and gradually build up to at least five nights per week to experience the best anti-aging benefits.” You can find an even gentler 0.2 percent in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Common Heir Retinol Serum</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re already a retinol user, have thicker skin, or are not particularly sensitive, you can try a middle of the road formula, which will have a 0.3 or 0.5 percent concentration; the highest possible concentration is one percent. “I would reserve the 1% for thicker, oily skins,” says Dr. Leipziger. “It can be appropriate for acne sufferers, but slow and steady often results in the best outcome.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you first start using retinol, you might experience what is known as “the retinol uglies,” although skin reactions will vary from person to person. “For some people, their skin may just be red, dry, flaky, and irritated for a few days as their skin adjusts to it,” says Dr. Mark. In other cases, it may cause a full-on skin purge, pushing congestion out of the pores that results in breakouts; this could last for anywhere from one week to two months, which is the main reason you want to ease into retinoid use. Starting a retinol regimen can be a shock to the system, so don’t be afraid to take it slow with a lower concentration.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You might find that some brands do not disclose the concentration of retinol in their formulas. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it may mean that it’s blended with other potent ingredients to deliver the best results without being irritating. It could also be a sign that the formula actually features the aforementioned bakuchiol, a plant-based retinol alternative, which is non-sensitizing yet provides comparable results.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Encapsulated Formulas</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You may see the retinol in your product being referred to as “time-release” or “encapsulated.” That means the formula’s active ingredient is literally wrapped in a microscopic shell that slowly melts after it's applied. “Encapsulation ensures the retinol is gradually released into the skin, allowing it to be more tolerable, as well as bathe the skin in a 24-hour cycle of the ingredient, which can be more beneficial,” says Dr. Leipziger’s medical esthetician, Kerry Elmasry. If your complexion tends to be a bit more sensitive, but you’d like to incorporate this potent ingredient into your routine, an encapsulated retinol product like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shani Darden Skin Care Retinol Reform Treatment Serum</a> may be the way to go.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Hydrating + Nourishing Ingredients&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because retinol can be notoriously drying on the skin, you’ll want to bring in reinforcements —&nbsp;namely ingredients that will boost hydration levels, protect your moisture barrier, and seal in nourishment. “I really like combining retinoids with hyaluronic acid for increased moisturization,” says Dr. Mark. You’ll find retinol paired with hyaluronic acid in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">LilyAna Naturals Retinol Cream for Face</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ceramides are another good pick: These fatty acids are naturally found in the skin and act as the mortar between the “bricks” of your skin cells, preventing moisture from escaping and allowing skin to stay balanced and comfortable.

Not only can niacinamide amp up hydration, but it can help lighten discoloration.

But while retinol is weaker than retinoic acid, you’ll still get all the same benefits from using the former. It'll just take longer: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>One study shows</a> that a prescription-strength retinoid takes about a month to significantly improve the look of fine lines and wrinkles, but an over-the-counter retinol provides the same results in about 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re willing to wait, it’s worth the reward —&nbsp;and because retinol isn’t as potent as retinoic acid, you won’t experience as much irritation, which we’d call a win.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What's the strongest OTC retinol?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The strongest retinol you’ll find over the counter is adapalene, which is the main ingredient in the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Differin Gel Acne Treatment</a>. “Differin was originally formulated for acne patients, but if your skin is thick and or oily, you can achieve the same benefits,” says Elmasry.
