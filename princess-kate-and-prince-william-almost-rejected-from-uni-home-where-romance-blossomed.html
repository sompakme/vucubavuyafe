However, the owner Charlotte Smith was reluctant to rent it to Prince William and his friends – even when she found out his identity.

"I said I’d talk to my husband about it and get back to her. My husband and I discussed it and he talked me round.

After dating for eight years, they opened up about their early relationship in their engagement interview in 2010. While Kate said she was "very shy" when she met William, she added that they "become very close friends from quite early." William added: "We moved in together as friends. We lived with a couple of others as well, and it just sort of blossomed from there, really.
