Shave this beard. Go into afro-mode, take out the braids. And I would just put my entire being into that performance.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Producer Amy Pascal previously told THR Miles will indeed come to live-action, but it would be after his journey wraps up in animation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_hailee-steinfeld_1 data-tag=hailee-steinfeld>Hailee Steinfeld</a>, the voice of Spider-Woman a.k.a Gwen Stacy, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-hailee-steinfeld-1235506319/>recently told</a> THR that playing the character in live-action would be an easy “yes” for her.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Across the Spider-Verse also lets viewers get to know Gwen Stacy better. Steinfeld opened up about what it was like bringing more of her character’s story to the screen in this film in compared to the first movie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I was thrilled to hear and discover that more of her story was going to be a part of this one,” Steinfeld said. “What I loved so much is that the filmmakers, it was very clear that they understood that she has this very, very bold voice that wasn’t about to go unheard.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The new film also features more of Morales’ parents, voiced by fellow returning actors Luna Lauren Vélez and <a href=# id=auto-tag_brian-tyree-henry_1 data-tag=brian-tyree-henry>Brian Tyree Henry</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Bringing this Latina mom in this animated movie with her son who’s Afro-Latino, I feel so lucky,” Vélez said of getting to show more of Morales’ relationship with his mother in this film. “I feel privileged. I feel so fortunate to be part of this incredible universe.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It feels reflective, because we know this family,” Henry added. “This is who we are. This is a reflection of the families that are going to come and see this.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Vélez and Henry revealed that, even though they play a married couple in the film, they recorded all their scenes separately. However, that was not the case for Moore, Steinfeld and the voice of Peter B. Parker, <a href=# id=auto-tag_jake-johnson_1 data-tag=jake-johnson>Jake Johnson</a>, who got to record some of their scenes in pairs.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s a way richer experience with other people,” Johnson told THR when asked how going in the booth with other actors compares to doing so alone. “You get to create your character opposite them.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Working … with Jake, it’s like pure comedy,” Moore added. “It really is nice to be able to look at them [while recording].”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“You feel it so much more,” Steinfeld said.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The stars shared that while Moore has gotten to record opposite both Steinfeld and Johnson, the voices behind Spider-Woman and Peter B. Parker haven’t stepped into the booth together, yet. Steinfeld and Johnson say they both would love to record with each other in the future. Perhaps for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse? The third film in the series is dated to hit theaters next spring.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Watch the video above for more from the cast of <a href=# id=auto-tag_spider-man-across-the-spider-verse_1 data-tag=spider-man-across-the-spider-verse>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLS8yJ2cq2WdlrturcKrpqyrXam1pnnSqaCdnaJiw6a%2B0p5kpqGcmsBuuc6rmKWdo2J%2Bc3%2BUbmdva2dlfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carmine-appice-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carmine Appice Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./19-best-sex-positions-the-favorite-sex-positions-of-real-women.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>19 Best Sex Positions | The Favorite Sex Positions of Real Women</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
