Because it's denser, the bubbles won't escape past it, so it's almost like an air blanket that sits on top of the bottle so that the CO2 stays inside the bottle."</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>As part of his role at Pernod Ricard Australia, Sheehy regularly holds tastings for Mumm champagne around the country and has tested the teaspoon theory out himself.</p><p>"We've looked at different ways and methods to keep champagne fresh and the old spoon in the bottle trick always comes up the same as if you just leave the bottle in the fridge with nothing in it at all," he said.</p><p>So what is the best way to try and keep your leftover champagne fresh?</p><p>"If you do have some left, the most important thing is the temperature," Sheehy told news.com.au. "You should never let the bottle warm up and then chill it down again. If you can keep it cold at all times, that will hold the bubbles/carbon dioxide in the liquid.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-lifestyle">Related articles</h2><p>"The next factor would be how much Mumm champagne is left in the bottle," he continued. "If you've only had one glass from the bottle then there's not much oxygen within the bottle itself, so it will tend to last longer. But if you've only got a small amount left, like one glass in the bottle, it will have been losing its fizz far quicker no matter what you do.</p><p>"The rule of thumb for me is if you've got one glass left in the bottle then don't even try and save it, just enjoy it.</p><p>"The next factor is the closure system," Sheehy said. "If you do have a champagne stopper, they're relatively easy to find and pretty cheap, keep the bottle nice and cold the whole way through and put the stopper in if you've got at least half a bottle or more left and get it back in the fridge."</p><p>Sheehy said that if you keep the bottle cold, have more than half the bottle left and use a stopper, the champagne should stay fresh for another 24 hours.</p><p>But if there's less than half a bottle left, the champagne will start to suffer after just four or five hours in the fridge, he said.</p><p>"The other option is a champagne preservation system," Mr Sheehy told news.com.au.
