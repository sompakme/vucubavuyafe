While Middleton has made it a point to attend Wimbledon every year as the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, this year her attendance was something of a looming question mark given her health.</p><p>So it came as little surprise that when Middleton arrived in a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.safiyaa.com/products/cecilia-lilac-midi-dress referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>purple Safiyaa dress</u></a>&nbsp;featuring a ruched bodice and softly flared skirt, the crowd gave her a standing ovation and her daughter reacted in the most Princess Charlotte way possible.</p><p>As Wimbledon attendees rose to their feat, Princess Charlotte beamed with pride while looking up at her mom. In response, Princess Kate waved back to the crowd, reportedly smiling as she grew visibly moved and emotional by the gesture.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/princess-charlotte-joins-kate-middleton-wimbledon-finals-amid-cancer-treatment-mommy-daughter-day-8676676 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>In an interview with People</a>, Karwai Tang‚Äîa photographer who was also present and who captured the emotional moment‚Äîsaid that the royal "usually comes in" and "walks down the step and into her seat."</p><p>"She doesn‚Äôt normally stand and wave," Tang told the publication. "But she stood for a while and took it all in. For her to acknowledge it and take in the applause was special."</p><p>To mark her second official public appearance, Middleton appeared to post a "welcome back" message of sorts on Instagram, along with a few pictures of the royal at Wimbledon.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
