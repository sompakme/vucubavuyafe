years, it's no surprise that Jersey Shore cast members have transformed their look - some more than others.</p><p>Alongside <a href=#>Angelina Pivarnick, who looks almost unrecognizable</a> these days, JWoww has <a href=#>changed a lot</a> - though she still claims that the only procedures she's had done have been two boob jobs, lip fillers, and Botox.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958419.jpg><h2>PRAYING MANTIS</h2><p><strong>2009</strong></p><p>When Jenni first stepped in front of the cameras, she was just 23 years old and she dreamed of becoming an animator for Disney or Pixar.</p><p>However, things changed as she auditioned to be part of the <a href=#>Jersey Shore</a> cast, a show that is still running to this day.</p><p>Back then, Jenni claimed that whenever she was done with a guy, she would bite their heads off â€“ and she was not afraid to swing her fist against men or women in the show.</p><p>The stunning castmate rocked her hair dark with side sweep bangs, and still enjoyed tanning obsessively.</p><p>At this point, Jenni had already undergone breast augmentation surgery, going from a B cup to an F cup.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Lifestyle</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673959211.jpg><h2>REDHEAD JENNI</h2><p><strong>2010</strong></p><p>By 2010, Jenni had begun to experiment with her hair color and went redhead for a few months.</p><p>She first tried steaks in her hair before dyeing it completely.</p><p>The bombshell also slimmed down as her face seemed more sculptured.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673959162.jpg><h2>NEW STYLE</h2><p><strong>2012</strong></p><p>By this year, Jenni had opted for a more subtle and sophisticated style as she stopped rocking icy-looking eyeshadow and her wardrobe consisted of darker and classic pieces.</p><p>She also got rid of the side-swept bangs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958456.jpg><h2>FIRST TIME MAMA</h2><p><strong>2014</strong></p><p>In 2014, Jenni gave birth to her first child with now-ex husband Roger, whom she met on the Jersey Shore.</p><p>The star kept a more natural look at this point and had yet to undergo any type of cosmetic procedure.</p><p>The only difference at this point was that she had treaded her red hair for blonde highlights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958417.jpg><h2>BOTOX?</h2><p><strong>2015</strong></p><p>Following the birth of her daughter Meilani, Radar Online wrote that it was possible the star got more than just baby weight on her face as she looked plumper and smoother.</p><p>It's possible that she also changed the shape of her eyebrows with the Botox as she looked to have a more awake look to her eyes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958424.jpg><h2>WHOA MAMA</h2><p><strong>2017</strong></p><p>By this year, Jenni was a mom of two and she looked absolutely amazing.</p><p>The Jersey Shore star sowed off a slimmer nose, though she claims it's her original nose, a more chiseled face, and plumper cheeks which could be the work of fillers.</p><p>Her lips also looked plumper and more shapely.</p><p>Additionally, she had undergone a second boob job to remove the old implants and put in new ones.</p><p>She claimed that after breastfeeding two kids, she was unhappy with her breasts and was encouraged by her husband Roger to get new ones.</p><p>To this day, Jenni only confirms she's had two breast surgeries and fillers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958453.jpg><h2>SINGLE WOMAN</h2><p><strong>2019</strong></p><p>By 2019, Jenni had divorced after years of unhappiness.</p><p>At this time, she rocked some of her most daring outfits, looking to show him what he was missing.</p><p>She also slimmed down throughout most of her body, which could have been due to the custody war she had with her now-ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958421.jpg><h2>CHEEKY GIRL</h2><p><strong>2020</strong></p><p>In 2020, Jenni's face had shifted once more with rumors that she'd had cheek fillers.</p><p>The apple of her cheeks seemed fuller, while the rest of her face looked slimmer - a possible sign of a cosmetic procedure.</p><p>The timing would have been great as the world shut down in 2020 due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673958420.jpg><h2>NEW ENGAGEMENT RING</h2><p>2021</p><p>&nbsp;This year, the star <a href=#>looked very different</a> with more lip fillers to create a Kylie Jenner-like pout.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Her eyes look brighter and more open as well, hinting that she has kept up the Botox injections.</p><p>Jenni is also <a href=#>now engaged to her boyfriend, Zack</a>.</p><span
