Piece</span><span>.&nbsp;For those who may not be familiar with the term manga, it is a style of Japanese comics and illustrated novels, for example:&nbsp;</span><span>One Piece</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Naruto</span></p><p><span>Oda’s signature&nbsp;</span><span>One Piece</span><span>&nbsp;is the best-selling manga in the history of the manga series.&nbsp;The work broke records in Japan, internationally and continues to do so to this day.&nbsp;We take a look at the genius behind this masterpiece.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Biography of Eiichiro Oda (Age)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Born in Kumamoto, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan on January 1, 1975, at the age of 4, Eiichiro decided to become a manga artist and avoided any possibility of getting a “real job”.&nbsp;It’s fair to say that his dream turned out well.&nbsp;Oda throughout his life had inspirations that propelled him to where he is today.&nbsp;The pirates’ obvious interest in Oda and his work was sparked by the popular Animation TV series&nbsp;</span><span>Vicky the Viking</span><span>&nbsp;and his biggest influence in manga comes from Akira Toriyama and his series called&nbsp;</span><span>Dragon Ball.</span></p><p><span>Oda started his journey to royal manga when he was a teenager, at the age of 17 to be precise.&nbsp;His first submitted work,&nbsp;</span><span>Wanted!&nbsp;</span><span>came in second place in the coveted Tezuka Award as well as winning other prizes.&nbsp;This success landed him a job at Weekly Shonen Jump magazine, initially working as Shinobu Kaitani’s series assistant.&nbsp;</span><span>Police gang</span></p><p><span>At 19, Oda had started working with Nobuhiro Watsuki on Rurouni Kenshin.&nbsp;He had previously been with Mizu Tomodachi Kappaman and Masaya Tokuhiro the&nbsp;</span><span>Tar-chan, King of the Jungle</span><span>.&nbsp;Oda also drew two unique pirate-themed stories, titled&nbsp;</span><span>Romance Dawn</span><span>.&nbsp;Monkey D. Luffy, protagonist of Romance Dawn, would later play the same role in&nbsp;</span><span>One Piece</span></p><p><span>After a few years of learning and improving his art style, in 1997 Oda started One Piece.&nbsp;It began serialization on Weekly Shonen Jump and evolved over the years to become the most popular manga in Japan and the best-selling manga of all time.&nbsp;One Piece tells the story of a young boy who wants to be the Pirate King and begins an endless journey with the Nakamas.</span></p><p><span>To give you an idea of ​​One Piece’s quality, let’s look at some numbers.&nbsp;By February 2005, One Piece had sold no less than 100 million collected tankōbon volumes.&nbsp;Fast forward to six years, the figure reaches over 200 million volumes.&nbsp;Its copies in print worldwide as of December 2014 amounted to 320,866,000 copies, and as of October 2017, 430 million volumes in circulation worldwide.</span></p><p><span>One Piece broke records for fun, continuously rising and breaking all previously set records on a regular basis.&nbsp;Volume 56 of One Piece sets the highest initial printing of any manga at 2.85 million copies.&nbsp;The next volume reached 3 million in 2010. One Piece won the 41st grand prize of the Japan Cartoonists Association Award in 2013.</span></p><p><span>Oda and his Manga friend Akira Toriyama created a crossover in 2007 that featured Toriyama’s One Piece and Dragon Ball characters.&nbsp;</span><span>Crusader era</span><span>.&nbsp;Dragon Ball holds the chalice of inspiration for One Piece.&nbsp;Eiichiro is very fond of One Piece fans who, even though he fell ill and was bedridden, made time to draw new chapters of One Piece.&nbsp;This was revealed by Masashi Kishimoto in 2013. Oda is a fan of rapper Eminem and is also a fan of singers Brook Benton, Izumi Katou, Avril Lavigne and Bryan Adams.</span></p><p><span>Apart from his involvement in manga creation, Eiichiro Oda is also involved in many charitable projects.&nbsp;In 2018, he donated $8 million to help Kumamoto Prefecture after the 2016 earthquake.</span></p><p><strong><span>Also Read: Justin Roberts (YouTube Star) Full Biography, How Old Is He, Who The Parents Are</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>His wife (Chiaki Inaba) and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Eiichiro Oda is married to a former model, Chiaki Inaba.&nbsp;Oda met Inaba when she was cosplaying Nami at Jump Fiesta performances in 2002.</span></p><p><span>The two started seeing each other and two years later, in 2004, the mangaka bonded over Inaba.&nbsp;The couple were blessed with a daughter in 2006.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGivmKR6qr%2BMnqCim5iev7B5zp2YrGWnnrOmecKhoJqjmWK2r63BmmShoaNisKm1y52pnqZdnba0ecCgnGaZnpl6qbXSZpmip5enrrG02Gg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./winona-ryder-stars-in-trailer-for-spooky-new-netflix-show-stranger-things.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Winona Ryder stars in trailer for spooky new Netflix show, Stranger Things</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-andy-gibb.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Andy Gibb?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
