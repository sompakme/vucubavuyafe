I'm sorry for the confusion and pain I have caused, and I'm sorry for not being able to tell more of my story from the beginning. I could have never anticipated the incidents which occurred on a private level to ever have happened, and I was trying my best to navigate the hardest thing I have ever been through."</p><p id=eMy8lHqaAdl data-wc=23>Following the announcement, according to People, the couple's lawyers emphasized their ultimate hope to "provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f46802b1b79-5ed37edc3ad861291e4a6745.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>Legal and medical advice</h2><p id=eGmQerun9wE data-wc=38>"We are privy to this case and given the facts at hand, we feel this was the best decision for Huxley," Myka and James' lawyers, Thomas Taneff and Taylor Sayers, said in a statement issued in May 2020.&nbsp;</p><p id=e8bq96uTU_T data-wc=25>"In coming to know our clients we know they are a loving family and are very caring parents that would do anything for their children."</p><p id=enK6cOp9Zt- data-wc=83>The legal team noted that the Stauffers consulted with multiple professionals in the healthcare and educational arenas to provide Huxley with the best possible treatment and care. "Over time, the team of medical professionals advised our clients it might be best for Huxley to be placed with another family," Taneff and Sayers continued. The lawyers clarified that the advice "did NOT include any considerations for placement in the foster system, but rather to hand-select a family who is equipped to handle Huxley’s needs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1cc0de92cc8-myka-and-james-stauffer-3-060624-80d46ee31b6b48ac85783a89ce8c7275.jpg><h2 dir=ltr>The scandal</h2><p id=etOHlwynXvK data-wc=18>Recently, Vox Media Studios revisited the viral scandal in a new docuseries titled An Update on Our Family.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewm8KbIT37Q data-wc=53>The three-part series, inspired by New York Magazine's 2020 feature on the family, includes clips from Myka's since-deleted YouTube videos leading up to their trip to pick up Huxley in Asia.
