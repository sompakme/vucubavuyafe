Can the players "reverse the curse" on an immunity idol that was previously played poorly? That's one of the many questions Ghost Island puts forth, but certainly not the only one.</p><p>While Survivor's&nbsp;own history is at the heart of the new season, the people actually battling it out for the latest million dollar prize are brand new to the game — at least in terms of playing the game.

Select highlights from Angela's CBS bio:</p><p><strong>Personal Claim to Fame:&nbsp;</strong>Retirement from the U.S. Army. I served over 21 years in the Army and I was an Army officer captain. I served in the transportation unit and in a psychological Operations Battalion as an executive officer and I was the ONLY female officer in the organization, yet still chosen to be second in command. I have been to several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, Dubai, France, Bratislava, Slovakia, Italy and Germany. I was put in the MOST unusual and extreme situations and conditions and survived better than most. I was in isolated conditions where life’s bare necessities were limited. While deployed to Iraq in 2003-2004, I went months with only taking bottle water showers. The supply lines were compromised so often I was forced to make a decision to either wash with my daily bottled water or consume it.&nbsp; I jumped from several different Military aircrafts and did drown-proofing that consisted of water survival. While deployed to Afghanistan, I was put in situations that required me to influence the local “elders” (leaders) of our U.S. missions in their country while at the same time earning their trust. This posed a huge issue because one, I am a FEMALE (and their beliefs with females are VERY different than ours) and two, I was an American.&nbsp; However, I was able to gain the trust of the local people as well as many elders.</p><p><strong>Inspiration in Life: </strong>My son.&nbsp; He has been braver than he believes, stronger than he seems and smarter than he thinks.&nbsp; I have never met a more amazing person than him.</p><p><strong>Pet Peeves:</strong> My pet peeves are laziness or unmotivated people when they have the ability and or resources to be and do so much more, and when someone expects someone else to pull their weight.&nbsp; One that believes things are “RIGHTS versus Privileges.” Also, unorganized people or things, close-minded individuals and people who think you “owe” them something.</p><p><strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong> Spontaneous, courageous and determined.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=11.420811017598><h2>Bradley Kleihege</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/110482_00981b_copy_-_h_2018_0.jpg><p>Originally from Michigan and currently living in Los Angeles, Bradley is a 26-year-old law student and super fan who was nearly cast on season 28, Survivor: <span data-scayt_word=Cagayan data-scaytid=2>Cagayan</span>. Select highlights from Bradley's CBS bio:</p><p><strong>Inspiration in Life:&nbsp;</strong>I don’t have a&nbsp;particular source of inspiration in life&nbsp;because I don’t believe in emulating or worshipping anyone.

I think I could use my&nbsp;charm&nbsp;to build relationships,&nbsp;and I think I have the competitive spirit and wit she had.</p><p><strong>Reason for Being on Survivor:&nbsp;</strong>It is the experience of a lifetime. You get to push yourself to your absolute limits and&nbsp;challenge yourself in a unique way. I believe I will learn a lot about myself and become a stronger person physically and mentally. The money would of course be helpful as well. I am looking to attend graduate school in the near future and it would be nice to not have any student loans after school.</p><p><strong>Why You Think You’ll "Survive"&nbsp;Survivor:</strong> I have the traits needed to make me successful.&nbsp; I am a hard worker who is extremely driven to reach my goals.

Select highlights from Chris' CBS bio:</p><p><strong>Personal Claim to Fame:&nbsp;</strong>My greatest accomplishment was being on a <span data-scayt_word=5th data-scaytid=9>5th</span>&nbsp;Avenue Versace billboard! It was by no means the end all and be all of where I want to be in life, but it was a major&nbsp;accomplishment. To me it was an accumulation of everything I’ve worked hard for finally getting justified. It was a huge symbol of perseverance and it was gratifying.&nbsp;I rely on my own self-motivation and have accomplished stuff that was difficult and took legit perseverance, but winning Survivor will top all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inspiration in Life:&nbsp;</strong>My ma is my hero. But it wasn’t always so. Growing up, my mom and I didn’t have the best relationship. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 27 and had me at 34. God bless her.&nbsp;A lot of side-effects of MS don’t just affect the body, but the brain as well, such as depression. So as a kid, I couldn’t handle or understand what was going on. I look back at my childhood and most memories of my mom and I were difficult.&nbsp;She would have seizures during&nbsp;my baseball games, at my school where she tutored, and the side effects of all the medications made it difficult to have a normal relationship with her. When I was 12, my parents split and the next couple years were even tougher as her disease progressed.&nbsp; If it wasn’t for my father telling me I needed to rise above the past and grow up, I would have continued to struggle. When I was told she had two months to live&nbsp;I decided to become a man at 17, and our past struggles brought us even closer. Through the years, our relationship grew, and our love and respect for each other brought our relationship to all-time highs. None of this would be possible if she hadn’t beat the odds for almost 10 years now. I will always idolize her perseverance, her grit and her faith in God. She is the greatest hero anyone can have and I live through her. She never quit or gave in when she was told she had two months to live, so why should I ever quit or give in when life “gets hard?” Want to talk about a Survivor?&nbsp; That’s my mom.</p><p><strong>Pet Peeves:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;My pet peeves are certain characteristics of people. If you are lazy and also a liar, I won’t like you. In fact, it angers me when people act lazy and try to manipulate everyone around them and ruin everything. Now, those pet peeves are going to be alive and well in the land of Survivor. Good thing I know how to dish it right back. I have been around people like that my&nbsp;whole life and I know how to deal with it. So yeah, my title of Most Dramatic, in the face of a bunch of liars will be, shall we say… interesting.</p><p><strong>3 Words to Describe You:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ambitious, charismatic and charming.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.4265129682997><h2>Desiree Afuye</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/110482_01164b_copy_-_h_2018_0.jpg><p>The Brooklyn-based 21-year-old was a lapsed Survivor&nbsp;fan, and is now ready to charge into Ghost Island with her eyes fearlessly on the prize.

Before her birth I was very overweight, smoked cigarettes, dabbled quite a bit at the craps table and would most likely be sitting down at the poker table on any given day. I recall a specific moment when my daughter was about a year old and she wanted me to take her outside on the swings. &nbsp;It was chilly that day so I had to dress warm. While putting on my shoes, I recall panting from being out of breath from the simple act of tying my own shoes. It was at that moment that I knew I had to make a change so that I would be around a long time for her and my other children that were soon to come. In the last seven years, I quit smoking, dropped 65 pounds and even though I can still occasionally be found in a poker room, I have dramatically prioritized where my income goes and where most of my money is spent, which is primarily bills and workout clothes for my wife.</p><p><strong>Survivor Contestant You Are Most Like: </strong>I know you are looking for one, but I am going to split this in three. Mostly <span data-scayt_word=Cirie data-scaytid=33>Cirie</span>, because I think she is masterfully empathetic with other players. &nbsp;She has an amazing ability to disable people. I hope I can do what she has done in the game. Second is Cochran. He wins in the emotional intelligence category that allows him to morph into whatever he needs to at the time. He also understands the importance of stroking other people’s egos when he needs to. This is something I hope I am capable of doing. And finally Rob Mariano, for the simple fact that we both come from Italian families with a background in construction. But more importantly, he sees the game big picture which is critical and I hope I can maintain.</p><p><strong>Reason for Being on Survivor: </strong>Obviously this is the opportunity of a lifetime to play this game, but this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to take a forced break from real life. And I don’t mean that I am happy to leave my family or my job, but this game will force me to be away from my life for a set period of time which I hope will open my eyes to what’s important when I get home. Oh yeah, and that money is mine!</p><p><strong>Why You Think You’ll “Survive” Survivor:</strong>&nbsp;I grew up in a house with eight siblings.
