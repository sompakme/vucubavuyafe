However, the flipside of Thug’s initial position as an unflinching and wholly unique renegade is that his less polarizing counterparts - from the Travis Scotts to the Lil Uzi Verts - have reaped the benefits of his trials & tribulations. As he clearly continues to sharpen his technical ability and refine his overall songwriting, public interest in his once-daring and innovative ways seems to have wavered.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This could be due in part to the restraint he’s shown since his breakout run in 2015. After a slew of minor-to-major hits (“Stoner”; “Danny Glover”; “Lifestyle), Thug made rap more colorful, more exciting and more genre-fluid. In 2017, Thug’s artistry isn’t any less tantalizing, but his output is more calculated. Where his career was once a whirlwind of tragic leaks and overlooked mixtapes, there was only one full-length release this year and, even more surprising, only a handful of leaks. What we got instead were a series of strategic guest spots, clearly meant to highlight his ever-growing talent as a vocalist and fledgling songwriter in the pop realm.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Thug has always been an impressively consistent artist, especially when considering his rate of output. But now that he’s pulled back on the reins a bit, it’s easier for folks like us to pinpoint just what makes him so poignant. His melodic blend of flavorful Southern rap and atmospheric late-90s R&B is now front and center, as are his elastic flows, dynamic vocals and lyrics that sway from slimey to disarmingly touching. Most every release he's attached his name to this year has felt purposeful. And, despite the lack of sheer volume, there are still numerous features and solo tracks worthy of note from this past year.</span><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>So, without further delay, here are our Top 17 Young Thug Verses from 2017.</span></p><p><br><h2>17. Louis B - "Celebrate" (ft. Young Thug)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Somehow, one of Thug's most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">promising snippets</a>&nbsp;ended up getting butchered and turned into a guest verse for up & coming Chicago rapper, Louis B. Fortunately, the standout passage from the original snippet - a concise rebuke of his relationship and subsequent fall out with his self-proclaimed idol, Lil Wayne - ended up in the official version and can now be considered as part of Thugger's cannon. "Growin' up I wanted to be just like Tha Carter/Politician, 'breviation, communication, humiliation left me with a scar on me," he pukes out all at once, as if it's been pent up since the days of Barter 6.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>16. Camila Cabello - "Havana" (ft. Young Thug)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">2017 has been the year of Pop Thugger. And with "Havana," an organic collaboration with ex-Fifth Harmony singer, Camila Cabello, becoming his highest charting hit to date (peaking at #2), it all feels like the perfect teaser for whatever Thug's got planned for 2018. This verse is a gem for a few reasons:&nbsp;</p><li>The opening "Jeffery" ad-lib&nbsp;</li><li>The self-awareness ("Fresh out East Atlanta with no manners, damn")</li><li>The&nbsp;relentless innuendos&nbsp;</li><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of those three, this writer's favorite has got to be the last one; seriously, it's like they knew how big this song would get and got Thug to act accordingly. He skillfully self-censors throughout his whole verse, never swearing but also never once compromising his usual content. The debauchery, the lust, even the violence - it's all there in coded language (this song deserves a Grammy for "Bump-bump-bump-bump her like a traffic jam"&nbsp;alone).&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>15. "Daddy's Birthday" (Verse 2)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Daddy's Birthday", a clear standout from&nbsp;Beautiful Thugger Girls, is a sublime ballad dedicated to family, fatherhood and growth. It plays like Thug cleansing his soul and reveals the delicate balance between Thug's own inner child and the fact that he's been forced into adulthood since&nbsp;even before he had his first kid at the age of 14. Also, Thug might be one of the only rappers capable of delivering an impressive verse while making it seem like there's an equally engaging 2nd verse going on in the ad libs. He thrives in these subtleties and they are an integral part of what make his songs so addicting.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>14. "All Da Smoke"</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Young Thug & Future's first collaborative effort,&nbsp;Super Slimey, got slept on, but it's understandable - this might've been the most hectic year in hip-hop in damn near a decade. Still, it would be a shame not to highlight the numerous stellar verses that can be found throughout this project. "All Da Smoke" sees Thug transitioning from shrill and crass to subdued and introspective at the drop of a hat. "This money turning me on, I'm thinking out loud," he screeches before singing about feeding deer in his backyard. It's this type of sporadic stream-of-consciousness that makes Thug such an entertaining and, often times, endearing writer.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>13. "Macarena" (Verse 1)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There were a few great Thug leaks this year (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Jeep"</a> and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Best of All Time"</a> being two that are worthy of note, even though they didn't make this particular list), but none were as relentlessly catchy as "Macarena." Although the second verse is&nbsp;a great example of the&nbsp;intangibles&nbsp;that make Thug so enthralling, the first is still the standout, with Thug's self-awareness stringing together what would otherwise be nonsensical one-liners. There are honestly too many in this single verse to quote 'em all, but these last six bars should do the trick:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Kingpin numbers, I'm not talkin' ringtones<br>Big bird sippin' Tussy, got me dead now (whoa)<br>I been drinkin' mud since I was peein' in the bed, whoa (whoa)<br>Hispanic dope floodin' all the bandos (whoa)<br>Look at transitions in my mug shots<br>You can tell I'm gettin' dough (ayy)"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Comically claiming to drink lean since you were a toddler is one thing, but "look at the transition in my mug shots, you can tell I'm gettin' dough," is just such wild, mind-boggling lyric. Sheesh.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>12. "For Y'all" (ft. Jacquees) (Verse 3)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This anthem towards the end of&nbsp;BTG&nbsp;is lively, energetic and defiant. It's also Thug at his most vulnerable. The third verse is short, sweet and tender. It sees him call his then fiancee, Jerrika Karlae, a "genius," his "idol" and the "girl version" of himself. That's after&nbsp;he opens by claiming: "I did everything for y'all to ball/Tell y'all risked it all to see a smile on y'all/I risked my future goals for all y'all." This is all done within 12 tight bars. It's the kind of high-wire&nbsp;exercise&nbsp;in balancing tone and content that Thug takes on on a daily basis and is in part why he's the versatile songwriter he is today.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>11. "Oh Yeah" (Verse 3)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thanks to a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">viral clip</a> from Rika,&nbsp; the third verse on "Oh Yeah" had been a fan-favorite long before it ever got an official release. While it's not lyrically all that impressive, this verse is a stellar example of Thug's mesmerizing vocal technique. From the way he accents his words to his soft croon,&nbsp;Thug proves yet again to be a unique and captivating vocalist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>10. "Family Don't Matter" (ft. Millie Go Lightly) (Verse 2)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Y'all knew this one was coming. We can't do a year-end roundup of Young Thug verses without excluding the formal introduction of Country Billy. Funny, visceral and ultimately just a joy to sing along to, Thug's 2nd verse on the&nbsp;BTG&nbsp;opener is a good time for all ages (well, maybe PG-13). Also, after listening to this track for the past half a year or so, we think it's safe to say that Thug may have a bright future in voice acting.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>9. The Weeknd - "Reminder (Remix)" (ft. Young Thug & A$AP Rocky)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another appearance of Pop Thugger, this remix really highlights just how deadly Thug could be if given a platform as large as The Weeknd's. He mimics the Toronto singer's cadence and song structure down to a T, but it takes a few listens to even grasp on to that fact because of how damn unique his vocals sound. It's like Thug took the stencil of this song and, while he chose to color within the lines, he somehow came up with a new image entirely. To anyone paying attention, this is Thug clearly prepping himself to enter the big leagues in 2018. And, as the days go by, it becomes more and more obvious why people like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">PartyNextDoor go out of their way to ape Thug's approach to songwriting</a> - they may very well be terrified of his potential.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>8. "Everybody" (Verse 3)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When Thug first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">teased</a>&nbsp;this leading up to the release of&nbsp;BTG, the internet ate it up. But you know how this story goes: the snippet went viral, everyone thought it would be on&nbsp;BTG&nbsp;(sounded very much like an "intro" type song) but it wasn't and then some jerk&nbsp;(or Robin Hood depending on your POV) leaked it to the public. Sigh. The song itself is captivating in a way most Thug songs aren't - it's got a stripped down, confessional vibe that slowly but surely builds to the standout third verse. It's clear that "Everybody" was a masterpiece in the making.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Calvin Harris proved to have a great ear for pop-rap this past year with&nbsp;Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1&nbsp;and "Heatstroke" is a strong candidate for most unexpected yet beautiful collaboration of the year. It's hard to believe this didn't became a smash hit considering all the talent involved.&nbsp;While both of Thug's verses fit perfectly in their respective pockets, it's really his intro to this track that elevates his overall performance. With those brief 8 bars, Thug showcases more range than most pop artists have done all year long.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>6. Frank Ocean - "Slide On Me (Remix)" (ft. Young Thug)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Frank Ocean must be a Thugger&nbsp;stan,&nbsp;because he made sure his first true collaboration with the elusive rapper only exists in obscurity on the internet. And what's more Young Thug than that? This remix to "Slide On Me," a track originally off of Frank's visual album,&nbsp;Endless, premiered on&nbsp;Blonded Radio&nbsp;over eight months ago&nbsp;and&nbsp;we&nbsp;still&nbsp;haven't received&nbsp;a CDQ or explicit version. No song with the line, "I screamed when I saw the titties on Janet Jackson, screamin' from the top of the planet," should be hidden from the public like this. Jeffery's got a mink on, he looks like a cub, he's higher than m'fn Aladdin's rug, he's rocking enough water to form an oasis and all he wants to do is ride in his Rolls away from the world. Aw, we feel you Thugger - 2017's been one helluva ride, hasn't it?&nbsp;</p><p><h2>5. "Killed Before" (Verse 2)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Killed Before"&nbsp;is Thug at&nbsp;his most dynamic and is a spell-binding turn on an otherwise reserved project. Thug attacks both verses with the precision of someone who's put in his 10,000 hours, but it's the arresting performance on the second verse that really earns this song its spot on our list. It's hard to name more than a handful of other rapper in the history of the genre who's exhibited as much raw vocal talent as Thugger, but the magic is not just in his execution. "Six kids with me, didn't think about abortions," he reveals, before crooning, like a demonic Michael Jackson, "I took a thottie outta Magic, took her to the pent, then I ooh oooh." As always, Thug is a dazzling mix of contradictions&nbsp;that somehow play out to be endearing and heartfelt.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>4. Drake - "Sacrifices" (ft. 2 Chainz & Young Thug)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Thug's high-profile features in 2017 didn't just highlight his powerful vocals, they started easing naysayers into the reality that Thug can - wait for it - actually&nbsp;rap. Between him washing Drake & 2 Chainz here, Bryson Tiller on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Get Mines"</a> and Rick Ross&nbsp;& <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Wale</a> on<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> "Trap Trap Trap,"</a> you would have to be willfully ignorant to think he can't pen a traditionally strong sixteen. "Traditionally" is relative through - even though he's as audible as he's ever been on "Sacrifices" he still writes, rhymes and flows like he's the rap game's Riddler. It's as if Thug hates when people think they got him pegged and he can't help but show them how foolish they are.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Just take a look at this passage right here:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I'm kickin' pimpin' like I punt (beat it)<br>But don't you think shit's sweet<br>I'm talkin' sweet, deer meat (ooh)<br>I'm talkin' suite like he sleep (like he sleep)<br>We ain't doin' too much talkin'<br>I'm talmbout talkin' like a speech (election)<br>Like the President, I kill 'em neat (scammers)<br>I’m talkin' neat like freak<br>I'm talkin' neat like fleek<br>I'm talkin' neat like a geek<br>You come with beef, I eat a B<br>I'm talkin' B’s, spellin' bee (sheesh)<br>Double R, that's a Rolls<br>Paint it yellow like it's dairy<br>I'm talkin' Rose like Derrick<br>I'm talkin' rolls like a belly (woo)"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Self-aware&nbsp;and disarmingly astute,&nbsp;Thug not only delivers a verse even old-heads can appreciate, he clowns them for thinking he can't rap in the first place. Sheesh.&nbsp;</p><p><h2>3. "Feel It" (Verse 1)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Imagine a world where "Feel It" actually came out in 2015, got the accolades it so clearly deserves and became Thug's first solo #1; a&nbsp;world where "I want that pussy in a Wraith," is the most quoted line of the year, followed closely by "I'm lovin' every single curve 'bout you" & "I'm so geeked up on your lovin' I don't need no mollies, I'm so for real (for real)." Imagine a world where Thug's most anticipated song, ever, isn't slowly becoming one of his most overlooked and underrated.&nbsp;That's the world this writer wants his kids to grow up in. But alas, here we are.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>2. "Safe" (Verse 2)</h2></p><p>Top 17 Best Young Thug Verses Of 2017</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Young Thug's best solo effort this year wasn't even on his album. "Safe," a surprise&nbsp;Youtube-only release from back in February, is a touching apology to his then-fiancee, Rika ("I got you boo/Together forever mean any problem that you got, bitch I got it too"), after they went through a very public fight. Although their relationship eventually crumbled before our very eyes, due to Thug's continued indiscretions, "Safe" is brilliant and heartfelt song that juxtaposes fame with paranoia, love with insecurity and family with independence. There are only a handful of songs in Thug's discography that are as emotional as this one and, even then, this is the most refined his songwriting as ever sounded. Here's to hoping Thug & Rika make amends somewhere, somehow down the line.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p><h2>1.

Never have we heard Thug address a loss of a loved one in such an exposed fashion; he didn't just wear his heart on his sleeve here, he ripped it out and held it out for the whole world to bare witness.&nbsp;"We Ball" is, without a doubt, his most vulnerable verse ever, let alone just 2017.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"When they killed my nigga, I seen the footage on the tape<br>Man I must've threw up everything I ever ate<br>Man I know he got some dice at the Heaven gates<br>Kicking shit with all these bitches like he's Kevin Gates<br>Relax your mind and kick your feet way up<br>Selling dog food tryna feed my pups<br>Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough<br>And I'm going through stuff I don't feel no love<br>And I shook your body and you still ain't wake up<br>Taking Perkys, man I fill my cup<br>The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The fact that he manages not only to provide such heartwrenching exposition, but leave us feeling hopeful ("fuck it, we ball"), is a testament to his craft and shouldn't be taken for granted. Not everyone is built like Thugger, and he knows it.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdpboR0gIytpqllYWx6o7HSrWSyp6WjtG7Ax66eZq6Vp8Cmv4yonWZqYGaEbrrEsKo%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-are-the-top-3-army-medals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What are the top 3 Army medals?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-list-for-taylor-swift-s-bad-blood-music-video-gets-more-amazing-every-day.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The cast list for Taylor Swift's Bad Blood music video gets more amazing every day</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
