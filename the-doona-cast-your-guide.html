At the peak of her career, Lee Doo-na (the former K-pop singer turned actress Bae Suzy) makes the surprising decision to drop out of her girl group <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEM9fQJpJvg" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dream Sweet</a> and spend her days in hiding at a college town sharehouse. There, she meets Lee Wonjun, a 20-year-old student living upstairs who barely knows who she is.</p><p>After an awkward first meeting that prompts some misunderstandings, a lonely Doo-na soon begins pestering Won-jun to eat together and hang out more often. Eventually they become close and must decide whether to act on their mutual attraction despite everything that stands in the way. Meanwhile, Doo-na has to decide if she wants to continue a life as an entertainer or fully join the civilian world, and Wonjun works to secure a stable job and navigates his feelings about an old flame who turns up at his university.</p><p>Doo-na and Won-jun's love story is a lovely and bittersweet saga, as the two young people learn more about themselves and the adult world while facing the small and large struggles that come while building a relationship. In addition to the main couple, Doona! is also a heartwarming show that will remind viewers of their college days and early '20s, from friendships and first loves to cohabitation with roommates and decisions about the future. To portray these stories, director Lee has gathered a cast of rising stars, led by Suzy in a role that seems tailormade for her.
