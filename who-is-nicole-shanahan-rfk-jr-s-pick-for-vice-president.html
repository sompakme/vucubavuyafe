Shanahan has spoken about growing up with a family that relied on food benefits and being raised by a schizophrenic father who had lifelong addiction issues. On Tuesday, she told the crowd of her days as an attorney, after completing a law degree a decade ago at Santa Clara University School of Law, working with artificial intelligence to push for criminal justice reform and end the school-to-prison pipeline for Black men.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Unmentioned at Tuesday’s event were the details of Shanahan’s rumor-plagued personal life, which no doubt played a role in her rise to national attention and becoming a vice presidential candidate. Her second marriage in 2018 was to one of the world’s richest men, Google co-founder Sergey Brin; the four-year union with the tech titan, during which the couple had a daughter, ended with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-affair-sergey-brin-wife-divorce-11658674840>reports</a> of an affair between her and the world’s (sometimes) richest man, Elon Musk, a longtime friend of Brin — both Musk and Shanahan have denied that this alleged tryst ever occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shanahan made a case for herself to <a href=# id=auto-tag_rfk-jr data-tag=rfk-jr>RFK Jr</a>. loyalists via talking points near and dear to the candidate: the chronic disease epidemic; the “corporate capture of our regulatory agencies”; the nation’s children, who she says are “not well” after “one shot on top of another shot,” a light reference to the MMR vaccine’s bogus link to autism, a false theory that was built on a lie and which her running mate has repeated for years.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Little was said that detailed Shanahan’s impressive amount of experience, which includes seats on multiple boards of directors, launching legal tech company ClearAccessIP and the private foundation Bia-Echo, and her growing list of strategic philanthropic gifts. Despite all of this before the age of 40, she is primarily discussed in regard to the reason for and terms of her divorce, with some <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://nypost.com/2023/09/15/google-co-founder-sergey-brin-finalized-divorce-from-nicole-shanahan/>speculating</a> that the case settled with her walking away with $1 billion. Such deep pockets have led to criticism of Shanahan as a potential — now-confirmed — VP pick, particularly after she bankrolled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/super-bowl-robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-spot-john-f-kennedy-ad-1235822195/>RFK’s&nbsp;Super Bowl ad.</a> The ad, which mirrored a John F. Kennedy campaign spot from decades ago, and which Shanahan said that she worked on, was poo-pooed by other members of the Kennedy family.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking to supporters as he introduced Shanahan, <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/cheryl-hines-interview-larry-david-marriage-robert-f-kennedy-jr-1235790790/ rel="noreferrer noopener">RKF</a> outlined why the 38-year-old, who has never held public office, didn’t quite make the case for his pick becoming the next vice president. But he did tell the enthusiastic-if–modest-in-size crowd how Shanahan is great for his campaign — which is currently facing the arduous task of ensuring the independent’s name appears on November’s ballots in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In fact, it’s precisely this tough task that led to Shanahan’s months-early addition to the ticket in the first place. For independent candidates, many U.S. states’ election rules require that a running mate be listed as the necessary ballot signatures are collected. Ahead of Tuesday’s event, the campaign stated that, to date, it has exceeded all of the ballot access benchmarks it had set for itself.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Shanahan’s addition to the ticket might be the moment that redirects RFK’s campaign; this is clearly the hope of both candidate and campaign, as she is on the young side of 40, that she will bring in votes from the youth “who have lost faith in their future,” as the candidate said Tuesday, for one half of a planned coalition the he says will also include America’s working class. Boasting a bank account that could fill his campaign’s coffers for months (recall that a VP pick may pump as much cash into a campaign as they like), a seat at the Big Tech table that comes with skepticism about the industry’s integrity, and practices that appeal to Biden-friendly youth and Trump-supporting working class.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And maybe most important of all: Shanahan has the oh-so-important quality of any VP: an unflinching loyalty to their boss. That was made clear during her rally speech, when she officially broke up with the Democrats, after donating for years to campaigns; she even claimed a “lifelong” affiliation with the party in February while speaking with <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-nicole-shanahan-interview-election-1883389 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Newsweek</a>. After taking both major parties to task, the VP candidate made the case on Tuesday for an Independent movement in America.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“If you ever considered an independent ticket … listen to Bobby Kennedy in his own words,” she said. “Take a look at his vision for America. It’s a vision that I share too, as I spend the next seven months of my life getting him on each and every ballot in this country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnoKS5qsDInKpmppWswHDDx6hkoqtdo7aku8ueZKygkaOuqa3NZqmfo11mf3SBl29ob2hmZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-spiders-not-like-walnuts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why do spiders not like walnuts?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-do-nylt-patches-go.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where do NYLT patches go?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./meet-moneybagg-yo-s-family-introducing-demario-dewayne-white-sr-and-whitney-white-moneybagg-yo.html></a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./white-shadow-actor-sag-aftra-president-was-71.html>'White Shadow' Actor, SAG-AFTRA President Was 71</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./long-nights-snakes-and-scorpions-yvonne-nelson-opens-up-about-struggles-of-filming.html>&amp;quot;Long Nights, Snakes and Scorpions&amp;quot;: Yvonne Nelson Opens Up About Struggles Of Filming</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./14-best-plus-size-shapewear-of-2024-tested-reviewed.html>14 Best Plus Size Shapewear of 2024, Tested &amp;amp; Reviewed</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./angelina-jolie.html>Angelina Jolie</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaDash.
