She claims that she never actually crossed paths with Meech, but rather, ran into his security and asked if she could wear the expensive jewelry. "My apologies if you feel disrespected, I can take the videos down if you'd like," Anisa Ali Abdu wrote back to the R&B diva before insisting that she's "not that type of woman." Afterward, the woman shared screenshots of her alleged messages with Lil Meech, revealing that he apparently offered to CashApp her money for making a post.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-summer-walker-is-over-the-drama>Summer Walker is Over the Drama</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite all the messiness the world has seen online, it seems Walker is unbothered by the situation. Before kicking off her weekend, she's been sharing some sweet snapshots with Meech on her Story, revealing that they spent their night turning up together. "Not me getting drunk and talkin' 'bout Toys R'Us lmao. She's a muva," the "No Love" songstress wrote in a closed-eye selfie that shows off her beautiful jewelry.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In another selfie, she and her 23-year-old beau give the camera a serious stare. He keeps one hand on his face, subtly flaunting his luxury watch for all of his girlfriend's followers to see. Do you think Lil Meech is "Playing Games" with Summer Walker's heart?
