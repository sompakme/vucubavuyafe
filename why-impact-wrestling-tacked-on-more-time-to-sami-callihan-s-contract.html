He may be a huge benefit for another company, or a great addition to any indie wrestling card around the country. Impact Wrestling may have bid him farewell, but they were actually able to keep him around even longer.</p><p>Sami Callihan had a run in WWE prior to his Impact Wrestling tenure. He was known as Solomon Crowe in NXT, but that didn’t last long. Of course, he became a breakout star for Impact Wrestling.</p><p>Sean Sapp noted behind Fightful’s paywall that Sami Callihan’s Impact Wrestling contract was frozen. This information came from a paraphrased interview with Callihan that he posed.</p><p>“He said that originally his IMPACT contract was supposed to be up December 30, 2022. However, his leg injury led to him having time tacked on. He says that things came down to the wire and a lot of people didn’t even know his contract was coming up. He said that he left on good terms, and that there’s always a possibility he returns to IMPACT, as he hasn’t burned bridges anywhere. He said the two sides were too far apart on terms and a deal was not reached.”</p><p>Sami Callihan may end up in AEW, because his old Switchblade Conspiracy stablemate, Jon Moxley, has a lot of pull in the company. On a sidenote, the other member of that indie wrestling stable was Joe Gacy, who now performs in NXT.</p><p>We’ll have to see what Sami Callihan does next in his career. He certainly has a lot of options at this point. Keep checking back with Ringside News for more.</p><p>Where do you think Sami Callihan should go next?
