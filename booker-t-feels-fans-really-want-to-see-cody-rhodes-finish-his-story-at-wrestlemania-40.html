However, WWE&nbsp;derailed those plans by having The Rock take his place at WrestleMania 40. Now, Booker T stated that he believes fans want to see Rhodes finish his story no matter what at WrestleMania 40.</p><p><a href=#>During the recent Friday Night SmackDown</a>, Cody Rhodes handed his WrestleMania 40 main event match to The Rock and this angered fans in a big way, starting a movement that only continues to gain momentum every single day.</p><p>While speaking on his <a href=#>Hall of Fame</a> podcast, Booker T talked about setting up a match between Cody Rhodes and World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins, Booker T expressed his opinion that people might not be interested in seeing Cody challenge Rollins because that’s not the ongoing storyline. He emphasized that fans are invested in seeing the story completed.</p><p>“I don’t think people wanted to see Cody challenge Seth Rollins because that’s not the story. It’s not the story. People want to see the story completed. I could be wrong. But I think a lot of people are really invested in Cody right now. And, oh, listen to Dallas Page. And he was saying, you know, there couldn’t be a better representative for WWE right now. Then Cody Rhodes.”</p><p>Booker T highlighted Cody Rhodes as a significant representative for WWE, stating that if Rollins were to drop the title, Cody, who has been putting in the work, would be the one to do it. He acknowledged Roman Reigns’ impressive tenure but emphasized the importance of Cody’s role. Booker T also mentioned the potential return of The Rock but noted that it might not happen.</p><p>”You know, Roman Reigns has done a hell of a job, and he’s done a hell. He’s been. You know, WWE is Larry Holmes. You know, it was holding on to that title. So, my thing is, if he’s gonna drop it, the guy that’s gonna be here putting the work in. It’s gonna be cold. It’s not gonna be rock. Does everybody know that Rocky is ready to go back on the road? He’s not gonna get back out there. But that doesn’t have to happen, you, I mean, so what that angle actually, you know, you might feel a certain weight going into it. Then the fans, you know, may react going into it, and I just don’t think that’s something that, like I said, I don’t know what’s going to happen.”</p><p>Despite uncertainties, he believes WrestleMania night will deliver value for the fans and acknowledged the frustration among fans invested in Cody Rhodes’ storyline, appreciating the emotional connection that wrestling narratives can create.</p><p>”Still, I think WrestleMania night the fans gonna get exactly their money’s worth and they’re gonna love it but every bit of it like it’s I just don’t want to write to show or anything like that. But I understand exactly where everybody’s frustration is coming from everybody’s frustration. I get it. Just because of this Cody thing, so many people have been investing. And that’s what I love about the business. You know, when you get the fans can emotionally connect, emotionally get on board with a story like Cody has done and created, you know, around, completing Dusty’s dream of holding the World Heavyweight Champion, a championship that he only got a chance to hold for a few minutes before they took it away from abroad bad.”</p><p>WWE’s intentions for The Rock taking away<a href=#>&nbsp;Cody Rhodes’ WrestleMania 40 spot has also been revealed</a>. <a href=#>‘We Want Cody’ signs were prominently displayed</a>&nbsp;during the February 5th WWE RAW episode. We’ll have to see whether The American Nightmare will be able to finish his story at WrestleMania 40.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on this story concerning Cody Rhodes?
